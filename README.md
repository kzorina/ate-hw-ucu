# ate-hw-ucu
It is repository with project for ATE course in MS DS UCU

Data is in folder data.

Helper functions are in package my_suite_helpers

Main file is ate_suite_zorina.py

The output.txt contains taxonomy the way I understand what the task was (better to say - suggestions about terms grouping and linking). It is far from perfect:(

Also I left code that was provided to us in hands-on sessions, from https://bitbucket.org/gendobr/ate.git
