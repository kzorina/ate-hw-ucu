A movie is considered to be a 2-dimensional semialgebraic figure that can change in time. We give a number of computability results concerning movies: it can be  decided whether a frame of a movie is only a topologically  transformation of another frame; a movie has a finite number of scenes and cuts and these can be effectively computed.  Based on these computability results we define an SQLlike query language for movie databases. This query language supports most movie editing operations like cutting,  pasting and selection of scenes.  1. Introduction  We present a data model for movies and movie databases. We consider a movie to be an infinite sequence of 2dimensional figures that evolve in time. Each figure consists  of a possibly infinite number of points in the 2-dimensional  plane. A recent and much acclaimed method for effectively  representing infinite geometrical figures is provided by the  constraint database model, that was introduced by Kanellakis, Kuper and Revesz in their 1990 seminal paper [10] (an  overview of the area of constraint databases can be found  in [13]). In this model, a 2-dimensional geometrical figure is finitely represented by means of a Boolean combination of polynomial equalities and inequalities. These involve polynomials with two real variables that represent the  spatial coordinates of a point in the plane. The set of points  on the upper half of the unit circle, for instance, is in this  context given by                In more mathematical terminology, these figures are called  semi-algebraic sets and for an overview of their properties  we refer to [3, 6].  This way of representing fixed figures can easily be  adapted to describe figures that change. Indeed, we can  add a time dimension and consider geometrical objects in  3-dimensional space-time that are described by polynomial  equalities and inequalities that also have a time variable .  This gives us a data model for movies. Figure 1 gives an example of a movie, in particular a potential scene from Star  Trek. In this short movie the starship Enterprise remains at  a constant position in space and can therefore be described          by formula             in which  is lacking. A fired photon torpedo  follows the dotted line (between the moments    and    ) an then explodes (depicted as increasing dotted circles, between    and   ). At the bottom of Figure 1  three frames of the movie are shown: at     and .  The complete movie can be described by the set                   (                       )    The movie of Figure 1 can be used to illustrate a number  of properties that all movies in this model have in common.         Figure 1. USS Enterprise firing a photon torpedo at a (cloaked) Klingon vessel.  For instance, between    and    the movie frames  change continuously and all frames (   ) are, topologically seen, the same. We will call such a sequence of  frames a scene of the movie. Moments in which the movie  changes discontinuously are referred to as cuts in the movie.  In the movie of Figure 1 there is, for instance, a cut at   :  a point changes into an increasing circle. The movie of Figure 1 has five scenes and six cuts (start and end of the movie  included). We remark that our notion of scene is finer that  the cinematographic notion of scene.  We will show that the number of cuts and scenes in a  semi-algebraic movie is always finite and that a representation of them by means of polynomial constraints can be  effectively computed. A key ingredient in this computation is a decision procedure for testing whether two movie  frames can be topologically transformed into one another,  i.e., whether they are homeomorphic. Although deciding  whether two 2-dimensional semi-algebraic sets are homeomorphic is a result that belongs to the mathematical folklore, a written proof of it is not to be found in the mathematical literature [15, 18]. We give a decision procedure and we  also generalize it to parameterized frames: there is an algorithm that, given two movie frames that depend on time parameters  and  , produces a formula built with conjunction and disjunction from formulas of the form      and   (  constants and   ) that expresses,  in function of  and  , whether the frames are homeomorphic.  Finally, we define an SQL-like language to query movie  databases. This language is based on the above computability results and on a well-known language to query databases in the constraint model, namely the relational calculus  augmented with polynomial inequalities [10, 16, 13]. It follows from a result by Tarski that the latter language is also  effective [20] (although variables range over the real continuum). Our query language supports all basic movie editing  operations like selecting scenes that satisfy some condition,  composing several scenes into a movie, removing scenes,  etc. It also allows for the manipulation of single scenes and  even of single frames.  This paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, we formally define the notion of movie, frame, scene and cut. Procedures to decide homeomorphism of frames and to compute the scenes and cuts of a movie are given in Section 3.  In Section 4, we present a query language and discuss expressibility issues.  2. Movies, Frames, Scenes and Cuts  We denote the set of the real numbers by . In the following we will consider planar figures that change in time.  A moving figure is described by means of an (often infinite)   , where and  represent  set of tuples     in  the spatial coordinates of a point in the 2-dimensional real  and  represents the time coordinate in . We first  plane  define the notion of a movie.  Definition 2.1 A movie is a set                      where  and  are real algebraic numbers and where      is a formula built with the logical connectives    from atomic formulas of the form      ,     a polynomial with real algebraic coefficients  with  and real variables   . The numbers  and are called  the beginning and end of the movie respectively and are de and  .  noted by  A movie database is a finite set of movies.           A set                  is a  scene of  if  is a maximal open interval in        such that  is continuous in each    .     A point  in which  in .        The movie of Figure 2 is continuous in every  in the  open intervals   ,   and  . These intervals  therefore determine the three scenes of the movie. There  are four cuts in the movie of Figure 2: in   , ,  and  . Remark that the beginning and the end of a movie are  always cuts.    Figure 2. An example of a movie.  Figure 2 depicts the movie             (                               )  in the space   . This movie shows at its beginning  (i.e., at   ) a single point in the origin. Then it shows a  disk whose radius increases and later decreases and ends in  a point at moment   , followed by a circle whose radius  increases, decreases, increases and then shrinks to a point.  , this movie shows nothing.  Finally, for       Definition 2.2 Let  be the movie                    and let     . The set            is called the frame of the movie  at the moment  and is denoted by Âź .    For the movie of Figure 2, for instance, the frame  is the origin,  is the closed unit disk and  is the  empty set.  We can use this same example to illustrate the notion of  a scene. For     , the movie of Figure 2 shows  a disk on which is zoomed into and then zoomed out of.  This continuous sequence of frames will be called a scene.  Also for     , we have a scene in which a circle is  continuously deformed. Scenes are separated by cuts.  In the following definition these concepts are formalized.  The notion of continuity that we will give may seem rather  involved. It corresponds, however to the intuitive notion of  âcontinuously changing,â as illustrated by the above example.          Definition 2.3 Let       be a movie and let            .  is continuous on the right in  if there exists an   and a continuous (in ) series                      of homeoÂź    morphisms of  such that      for all        .  is continuous on the left in  is  is continuous in  if it is  defined similarly. And  continuous both on the right and on the left in  .    is not continuous is called a cut    3. Computability Results  In this section, we present two computability results concerning movies. First, we show that it is decidable whether  two (parameterized) frames are homeomorphic. Next, we  will show that a movie has a finite number of scenes and  cuts and that formulas describing them can be computed  from the formula that defines the movie.  A key lemma in this context is the following.  Lemma 3.1 It is decidable whether two movie frames are  isotopic1 , and also whether they are homeomorphic.  Proof (sketch). Let  and  be two movie frames.  and   are homeomorphic if and only if  is isotopic to  or to  a reflection of  (see, e.g., [7, 14, 19]). It therefore suffices  to prove that it is decidable whether  is isotopic to  .  The algorithm to decide isotopy first computes for    , respectively  the labeled planar graph embedding    as follows. The nodes of   are the âsingular pointsâ of   , i.e., the points that do not belong to the topological interior of  or the complement of  , nor to a topologically  smooth border of  (see [12] for a formal definition) together with the lowest left most points on each closed curve  of the topological border of  on which there is no singular point. As an illustration, we take the frame  shown  in (a) of Figure 3. The singular points of  are  and  . The closed polygon in the right upper corner of  does  not contain a singular point and has more than one most left  point. Of these the lowest is picked: . We remark that the  singular points can be computed by means of a first-order  formula in the theory of the real numbers. It was shown  by Tarski that this theory is effective [20], and symbolic  algorithms for the first-order theory of the reals [1, 5, 17]  can effectively compute the nodes. The computation of the  other nodes can be performed via a Cylindrical Algebraic  Decomposition (CAD) [5] (see also [1]).  1 Isotopic means homeomorphic by an orientation preserving homeomorphism.                                      Â˝              (a)  (b)  Figure 3. A frame of a movie  (a) and its graph  (b).  In the graph   (see (b) in Figure 3) these nodes are  labeled with typed labels:  for nodes that belong to   and  labels for nodes that do not belong to  .  Next, the connected components of the intersection of   with the topological border of  minus the labeled points  are computed. These form edges of   and are labeled  with labels of type   . Similarly,  labels are given to the  connected components of the border that does not belong  to  . The topological border of a frame can be computed  in the first-order theory of the reals. The computation of  connected components of a frame is described in [4, 8, 9].  Finally, the areas formed by the graph embedding are computed and labeled   , respectively  depending on their  containment in  . Let the sets of labeled nodes, edges and  areas be called  ,  and  , respectively.  From results in [11] it follows that  and  are isotopic if and only if there exist bijections     ,     , and     that map -labels    to -labels and -labels to -labels and that preserve the  clockwise occurrence of edges and areas around each of the  labeled nodes. These conditions can be verified. It is therefore decidable whether two movie frames are isotopic.   It should be remarked (details omitted) that it can be decided whether two frames  and  are isotopic in polynomial time (in the size of the polynomial constraint formulas  that describe  and  ).  Theorem 3.1 Let  and  be two movies. There is  an algorithm that on input these two movies produces a formula ĂÂ˝ ĂÂž     built with conjunction and disjunction  from formulas of the form     and   (   constants and   ) that expresses, in function of  and   , whether the two frames Â˝ and Âž are isotopic (the  same is true for homeomorphic).  Proof (sketch). Let  be the movie                  Collins proves that from the for       a Cylindrical Algebraic Demula   composition (CAD)  of   can be computed such that    or to the complement  each cell in  entirely belongs to  of  [5] (see also [1]).  induces a CAD   of the  plane which in its turn induces a CAD   of the -axis. For  the movie of Figure 2 this is illustrated in Figure 4. The  cells of  are points, lines, curves, 2-dimensional surfaces  and 3-dimensional areas that are built as stacks on the different cells of  . The cells of  are the (black and grey)  dots, arcs and patches of white space in Figure 4 (compare  with Figure 2).   consists of the grey dots on the -axis and  the open intervals determined by them as shown in Figure 4.  The cells of  are stacks built on these points and intervals. It can be easily shown that the movie  is continuous  in each  that belongs to one of the open intervals of   . So,  remains isotopic in these intervals. The only possible  cuts of the movie are therefore the points of   (grey dots).  The algorithm we seek could therefore work as follows.  and  Compute, using Collinsâs CAD algorithm, both for  the representatives of all the cells in the induced CAD   . Let these be          and           respectively. Decide, using Lemma 3.1, for each pair    in the set                , whether  is  .

From the proof of  the previous theorem it is clear that there are only a finite  number of cuts and scenes. The cuts are among the points  of the induced CAD   . Not all these points must be cuts,  however. For the example of Figures 2 and 4, the grey dots  at      and are cuts. The one at   , however,  is not.  For what concerns the computation of the scenes and  cuts, we first compute the candidate points for cuts (namely,  is conthe points in  ). It remains to be tested whether  tinuous in these points. Let  be a point in  different from  in  the beginning or end of . The test for continuity of   is two-fold:  Âź  is isotopic to two frames  1. test whether the frame  Âź  Âź   and  in the neighboring intervals;  2. test for each       (resp.   ) whether for  each small enough   and each Ă  there exist a  points Âź   Âź  and ÂźÂź   ÂźÂź  at distance at most Ă from     such that Âź   Âź        (resp.  ) and  ÂźÂź  ÂźÂź      (resp.  ).  The first test can be performed using the techniques outlined in Lemma 3.1. The second test can be expressed as a  sentence in the first-order theory of the reals and is therefore  effective [20]. Condition 1 is clearly necessary for continuity. It is, however, not sufficient. At a cut, a frame can,  for instance, just jump to a different location. This would  not violate Condition 1. Condition 2 guarantees that there  is not a jump. When it is decided which of the points of    are cuts, the computation of the scenes is straightforward.  Collinsâs algorithm produces polynomial constraint formulas for all the cells in a CAD. The scenes and cuts can therefore also be given by means of their defining polynomial    constraint formula.  4. Querying Movie Databases  In this section, we present an effective SQL-like language to query movie databases:  SQL. This language  is based on the computability results of the previous section  and on a well-known query language for databases in the  constraint databases model, namely the relational calculus  augmented with polynomial constraints.  First, we define  Definition 4.1 A movie database query is a mapping that    maps every -tuple of movies to a movie.  In the following, we will consider queries that have parameters    .  The calculus: We will use the relational calculus augmented with polynomial constraints, the calculus for short,  as an essential part of SQL. The calculus was introduced  and studied in, e.g., [10, 16] (see also [13]).  A calculus formula            is built from the atomic formulas     (       )  and         ( a polynomial), the logical connectives    and the quantifiers  .        The calculus formula       (             ), for instance,  defines the moments when there appears a circle (as a sub.  set) in movie  The language  is of the form        SQL: An elementary query in  SQL                 ,  where  and are real algebraic numbers and  is a condition that can be expressed by means of the usual logical  connectives and quantifiers, calculus expressions, other elementary SQL queries and the following primitives:                           , with  a calculus formula  and  and  computable 2 functions that work on inputs     and      ( a nat-  ural number), respectively, and return natural numbers.

The meaning  of these queries is the obvious one and will be illustrated by  the consequent examples. The function of the -part of  an elementary query is to indicate which of the input movies  are under consideration. It should be noted that some of  these primitives are redundant and are only added for ease    of use. From the proof of Theorem 3.2 it follows that  can be expressed in terms of  .  Finally, we remark that     Theorem 4.1  SQL queries are computable.  2 This means computable on the polynomial constraint formulas that  define the movies.  Proof (sketch). Let  be a SQL query. Given the polynomial constraint formulas of the input movies    ,  we can, by Theorems 3.1 and 3.2 replace all the occur,   and   in  by conrences of  crete constraint formulas. Also the beginning and end  of movies can be computed (from a CAD, for instance).   and   can be reTherefore all occurrences of  placed by concrete constraint formulas. This way we obtain  a first-order formula over the reals, that can possibly contain quantifiers. From Tarskiâs quantifier elimination theorem it follows that these can be eliminated [20]. This yields  a polynomial constraint formula for the output of the query  . The output is guaranteed to be a movie by the syntactic  that appears in the   part of elecondition    mentary SQL queries.              We give some examples of SQL queries, that illustrate  that all the basic movie editing operations can be performed  in SQL:  that are  Example 1: âGive all the frames of the movie  homeomorphic to a circleâ is expressible by the elementary  query                              !         !      .

Discussion and conclusion  We have presented a data model for movies and movie  databases, in which a movie is considered to be a 2dimensional semi-algebraic figure that can change in time.  We have given a number of computability results concerning movies: homeomorphism and isotopy of movie frames  are decidable; a movie has a finite number of scenes and  cuts and these can be effectively computed.  Based on these computability results we have defined an  SQL-like query language for movie databases. This query  language supports most movie editing operations like cutting, pasting and selection of scenes.  We remark that the presented model is very elementary  and that it can be extended and made more suitable for practical applications in many ways. For instance, the movies  that we consider here have frames that are purely black and  white (even without variations of grey and certainly without  colors). Movies have one single âimageâ, whereas many  movies (e.g., cartoon movies) are multi-layered. The presented model can be extended to cope with this.  Finally, we remark that our model cannot straightforwardly be applied to existing movies. The problem of converting cinematographic movies, for instance, into the proposed model is beyond the scope of this paper. We remark  however that a number of 3D animation tools and virtual reality environments work with data that can be readily converted into the constraint model. 3D Studio Max [21] and  Virtual Reality Modeling Language (VRML) [2] are examples of such environments.
