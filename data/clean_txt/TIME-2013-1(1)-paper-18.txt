2013 20th International Symposium on Temporal Representation and Reasoning  Making Time Just Another Axis in Geospatial Services  Piero Campalani, Dimitar Misev, Alan Beccati and Peter Baumannâ  â School of Engineering & Science (JUB), Bremen, Germany  Email: {p.campalani,d.misev,a.beccati,p.baumann}@jacobs-university.de  Alongside, the consolidation and advancements of standards for the geospatial realm ([8], [9]) are creating  premises for open interconnectedness and interoperability  of location-based web services. In particular, the Geography  Markup Language (GML) â the XML grammar deďŹned by  the Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC) â is a description  of application schemas, transport and storage of geographical features, as they are described in the ISO 19100 series of  standards and the OpenGIS Abstract SpeciďŹcation. Among  the several conceptual models covered by GML (e.g. spatial  geometries, coverages, units of measure), of particular interest for this work are the schemas for Coordinate Reference  Systems (CRSs), a key aspect of geoscience datasets, and  their application to gridded coverages.  In [10] the authors described the advantages of a  GML-oriented approach for referencing geospatial data  when implementing services on the web, and this inevitably  needs to include a proper management of the temporal  information. Time should not be meant as just an additional  attribute, e.g. support information, but should be integrated  in the model of a coverage as a coordinate on its own,  wrapping time series of data onto a single object, this  way extending querying and processing capabilities of web  services to the temporal dimension [11]. This is eagerly  awaited by the scientiďŹc community, including geo image  services ([12], [13]), the Model Web ([14], [15]), or geological sciences [16].  In this article we will propose a framework for serving regular/irregular time series of datasets by means of  spatio-temporal CRSs in an OGC-oriented Web environment, and by seamless integration of the temporal dimension in the generic n-dimensional space of analysis, with  focus on the implications for the OGC Web Coverage  Service (WCS) [17] and Web Coverage Processing Service  (WCPS) [18]. After an overview of related works in Sec. II,  Sec. III will introduce the syntax behind the speciďŹcation and  web-based retrieval of CRS deďŹnitions; Sec. IV will describe  how GML addresses the recording of temporal coordinates  as well as the concepts of the proposed framework; practical  examples are presented in Sec. V; conclusions are eventually  drawn in Sec. VI.  AbstractâThe use of large multidimensional, complex  datasets to study the roots and the consequences of real-world  phenomena is systematically gaining importance in the recent  years. These datasets and their requisite metadata can be  managed by queryable databases, and the increasing processing  capabilities of distributed computing and Array DBMS are  opening new scenarios for Web-based access and analysis.  The spatio-temporal nature of these observations requires the  establishment of an automated machine-readable system that  seamlessly accounts for time as not just an attribute, but  rather as one more axis in the n-dimensional structure. This  paper proposes a conceptual framework for the integration of  temporal with spatial dimensions. Based on the widely used  Geography Markup Language (GML) it exploits temporal  Coordinate Reference Systems (CRSs) in analogy to, and  interoperable with, well-known spatial CRSs. The proposed  approach is then concretely applied to the OGC Web protocols  Web Coverage Service (WCS) and Web Coverage Processing  Service (WCPS), by means of which a user can visualize,  aggregate, process remotely stored archives of scientiďŹc data.  It is based on an open-source CRS resolver, SECORE, which  translates URL identiďŹers of CRSs into their GML deďŹnitions.  SECORE has been adopted by OGC as its standard CRS  resolver, and the whole concept is supported by an ad-hoc  OGC working group.  Keywords-time series; coordinate systems; geoservices; big  data;  I. I NTRODUCTION  The increasing availability of multidimensional scientiďŹc  datasets is giving room to a always wider range of applications that can take advantage of jointly spatial and temporal  analytics capabilities [1]. In particular, Earth monitoring via  satellites and remote sensing technologies offers a powerful  mean for analyzing long-term datasets that are crucial for a  clearer understanding of phenomena and thus for prevention;  rising atmospheric CO2 or the Antarctic ozone hole were  indeed discovered by a fruitful analysis of spatio-temporal  datasets.  Developing applications can transversely span a variety  of different domains, from land use [2] to cryosphere  analysis [3], from environmental heritage [4] to planetary  sciences [5], and more. The mere visualization of the data  is usually not enough if not accompanied by analysis and  consequently adequate processing capabilities [1]. The rising  of distributed computing resources as commodity services  and the systematic development of Array DBMSs ([6], [7])  are making it possible to achieve important speed increases  for analyses.  1530-1311/13 $26.00 ÂŠ 2013 IEEE  1550-1311/13  DOI 10.1109/TIME.2013.24  II. R ELATED W ORKS  The extension of spatial data models to the temporal  dimension in a uniďŹed manner is a crucial aspect when  119  133  investigating dynamic phenomena [19]. Augmenting spatial  modelling and analytics capabilities with temporal semantics  has been addressed in in many areas of geosciences, dating  back at least twenty years [20].  In recent years there has been a growing attention on  the ďŹeld of spatio-temporal databases and how to query on  them [21]. Such databases deal with geometries which can  change over time in order to provide a DBMS data model  and SQL-integrated query language capable of handling  time-dependent geometries [22].  The proposed URI-based model of referring to a temporal  dimension can be applied independently of the type of  geometry of the desired feature, whether it is a point cloud  over time, a time series of images, a trajectory, and so on.  This architecture might be seen as an additional extension,  to be built on top of spatio-temporal databases to enable an  online, and most of all interoperable, query interfaces.  Regarding OGC standardizations, this is not the ďŹrst  effort to establish a ďŹrst-class citizen temporal dimension:  for instance, Web Map Service (WMS) â most notably  implemented by open-source geoservices like MapServer  and GeoServer [23] â is working on the visualization of  multidimensional gridded data with temporal capabilities  via a âTIMEâ parameter [24]. Time is treated as a special  dimension, with mechanisms different from spatial selection.  The hereby discussed schema tends instead to a uniform  inclusion of time, with no particular special treatment with  respect to other spatial axes in the n-D aquarium.  Outside the context of OGC there are other ever-growing  initiatives for temporal analysis of features and timegeography.  For instance, an international group of archaeologists,  geoscientists, and experts in geomatics and data acquisition  is emerging with the common goal of developing an international data standard for archaeological 4D data [25].  The R environment for statistical computing can already  offer packages for the analysis of spatio-temporal datasets of  different natures (e.g. points, grids, trajectories) with ďŹrstclass citizen time analysis, as well as space-time statistical  modelling tools [26].  Still at an early stage, the temporal extension for  PostgreSQL, PostTIME [27], is currently being developed,  and it is capable to manage different types of temporal  reference, based on either temporal coordinates, calendars  and as well ordinal systems.  In all these cases, still there is a lack of ďŹexibility when  it comes to deďŹne custom CRSs for time, and usually one  cannot have more than one single temporal dimension.  Indeed, one of the key-point of our proposal is the freedom to generate custom ad-hoc temporal reference systems,  and to attach one or more of them to the owned datasets.  Several services need to deďŹne custom geospatial (or planetary) CRSs, and many of them can be fetched from Spatial  Reference [28] in different formats, GML included. Our  inherently distributed URI-oriented CRS resolver could coexist with it providing means for composing spatio-temporal  CRSs that reliably host the data to be served, independently  of the internal architectures.  III. CRS  IDENTIFICATION  Coordinate Reference Systems contain all the information  necessary to precisely relate abstract coordinates to concrete  physical locations, in either space or time. As such they are  at the heart of all applications dealing with real-world data,  when the knowledge of its unique physical coordinates is  essential. CRSs can be fully described in several machineunderstandable languages, including Geography Markup  Language (GML) and Well-Known Text (WKT).  Communicating complete CRS deďŹnitions is rather impractical, especially since a vast majority of the GIS applications rely on some commonly accepted standard Spatial  Reference System IdentiďŹers (SRID). Concerning geospatial  CRSs, virtually all major spatial vendors have created their  own SRID implementation or refer to those maintained by  an authority, such as the Oil and Gas Producers (OGP)  Surveying and Positioning Committee. The EPSG SRID  value for the WGS84 CRS is 4326 for example. Based  on SRID codes and the now deprecated CRS URN identiďŹers [29], we have devised a simple, expressive, and HTTP  compatible mechanism for CRS identiďŹcation and deďŹnition  management. A brief overview is given here; for full details  we refer the reader to [30], [31].  CRS identiďŹers are modelled as Uniform Resource Locators (URL) [32], which uniquely resolve to the according  CRS deďŹnition. This ďŹts well into the OGC Web Service  (OWS) Common standard [33], according to which CRS  references are XML attributes or elements of type anyURI.  Furthermore, it takes advantage of a well established architecture rather than introducing new protocols for resolving  the identiďŹed CRS deďŹnition. A Web service which understands CRS URL identiďŹers and is able to dynamically  construct and respond with an according CRS deďŹnition is  already available, and will be soon deployed at OGC.  Next we present the syntax and semantics of CRS identiďŹers. We have categorized CRS identiďŹers into three types,  according to the types of deďŹnitions they refer to.  A. Single CRS  A single CRS deďŹnition is uniquely identiďŹed by the  authority that maintains this CRS, the deďŹnition version,  and the SRID code. This translates to a URL identiďŹer in  key-value pair (KVP) format as shown in Listing 1.  Alternatively, we can have a RESTful URL equivalent  (see Listing 2), in which case the argument order is ďŹxed  to authority, version, code: âhttp://www.opengis.net/def/crs/  EPSG/0/4326â is an example of such identiďŹer for the wellknown WGS84 CRS.  134  120  { r e s o l v e r âp r e f i x } / d e f / c r s ?  a u t h o r i t y ={ a u t h o r i t y }&  v e r s i o n ={ v e r s i o n }&  code={code}  Listing 1.  { r e s o l v e r âp r e f i x } / d e f / crsâcompound?  1={ l a t / l o n CRS i d e n t i f i e r }&  2={ h e i g h t 1D CRS i d e n t i f i e r }&  3={ t e m p o r a l CRS i d e n t i f i e r }  Single CRS identiďŹer (KVP format).

CCRSs have been widely used to chain horizontal and  vertical CRSs, which indeed in historic geodetic practice  used to be determined independently [37]. This concept can  be extended to involve theoretically any viable combination  of CRSs, in both space and time. For example, there is  no pre-existing coordinate reference system for referencing  4D latitude/longitude/height/time data, so we can get a  compound CRS on the ďŹy with an identiďŹer like the one  shown in Listing 4.

Example of an AUTO2 parametrized CRS with two  parameters.  B. Parametrized CRS  IV. T EMPORAL CRS  A parametrized CRS is an incomplete, abstract CRS,  where some parts of the deďŹnition have to be provided by  the identiďŹer in order to instantiate a concrete deďŹnition.  A parametrized CRS deďŹnition references the single CRS  which will be instantiated, and a list of parameters. Each  parameter has:  â˘  â˘  â˘  Compound CRS identiďŹer.  R (and ISO) GML encoding standard offers a  OpenGIS  wide variety of XML application schemas for expressing  geographical features: it is clearly not limited to the purely  spatial description of an object, offering models for the  handling of temporal geometries and temporal reference  systems as well.  A coverage is a subtype of feature that has a spatiotemporal domain and a set of homogeneous 1- to  n-dimensional tuples, and may either represent one feature  or a collection of features [38].  A CRS is usually meant as a spatial coordinate system that  is related to Earth through one datum (geospatial CRS), but  in its generic deďŹnition a CRS might be bound to any object,  whether it is an ellipsoid representing a different planet, or  as well a temporal calendar for instance. In the latter case,  we would then have a temporal CRS.  Indeed GML provides the gml:TemporalCRS type, simply deďŹned as 1D coordinate reference systems used for the  recording of time [38]. Listing 5 shows the relative XML  type deďŹnition, which is basically composed of a temporal  Coordinate System (CS) and a temporal datum.  As shown in Listing 6, a gml:TimeCS provides the  deďŹnition of one single axis which in turn deďŹnes the proper  temporal metadata, i.e. the unit of measure (@uom) and a  label, or abbreviation (axisAbbrev). The abbreviation is  unique and mandatory and could be easily used as identiďŹer  for the time dimension when dealing with web requests  that need to fetch e.g. a sub-portion of the coverage in  the temporal dimension (examples will follow in the next  section).  Optionally, a coverage service might deďŹne minimum and  maximum values usually meant for that temporal axis, and  as well a direction which could be of practical use e.g. when  dealing with temporal dimensions which are heading to the  a name, by which it can be referenced in the CRS  identiďŹer;  an optional value, which can be a single value â as a  default if none is supplied in the identiďŹer â or a formula (Java Script expression [34]) which can compute  the value based on the values of other parameters;  an optional XPath target expression specifying where  in the referenced CRS deďŹnition should the value be  set.  This new CRS type allows to create very ďŹexible CRS definitions and thus avoids creating new predeďŹned deďŹnitions  whenever some parameters need to be slightly different.  For example, Listing 3 identiďŹes the Auto universal transverse mercator Layer CRS (AUTO2:42001) as speciďŹed in  WMS 1.3 [35], which is an automatic spatial coordinate  reference system which gives the user the possibility to  customize the centre of projection. This way the proposed  parametrized CRS lets the user specify this centre of projection as a tuple of latitude/longitude degrees (over Pensacola  FL in the example), which are internally handled to set the  correct central meridian and false northing parameters of  the deďŹnition. Further details on CRS parametrization can  be found in [30].  C. Compound CRS  A Compound Coordinate Reference System (CCRS) is  deďŹned as an ordered composition of single non-compound,  non-repeating component CRSs [36]. A URL identifying  135  121  In addition to any custom unit of measure that could be  referenced by an external URI, there are well-known labels  which could be directly applied, e.g. a for year, wk for week,  and so on (see [39] for a thorough list).  With regards to the complex GML modeling of stratigraphic geological time scales (see [40] and [41]), an  absolute chronometric approach might be more practical,  for instance by setting a time reference system with units  millions of years (Ma), positive backwards.  In practice, the purpose of this framework is to let  the system work with numerical coordinates by indexing  the temporal domain, this way enabling OGC-compliant  spatio-temporal queryable datasets on a web service. Indeed, when describing the topology of a spatio-temporal  feature in GML â that is where or when the feature  components (points, lines, solids) are â then an element  of type gml:DirectPositionType (a list of IEEE doubleprecision 64-bit ďŹoating-point numbers) is always required,  whereas descriptive textual representations are not possible.  The service shall thus deďŹne a gml:TemporalCRS with  proper resolution and origin for the referred dataset, so that  the domain of validity in time of the CRS can include its  temporal extent. The URL identiďŹer of the newly created  temporal CRS (see Sec. III) can then be concatenated to the  spatial CRS of the feature in order to safely automatize its  spatio-temporal reference system and to correctly translate  the requests into the internal database system.  As a visual example, Fig. 1 depicts a time series of  aerosols vertical proďŹles from lidar observations onboard  the CALIPSO satellite: a single 3D gridded coverage jointly  binds three images in order to form a unique cube for spacetime queries. As previously explained, the transition from  the single image to the time series is achieved by extending  its inherent geodetic CRS to a spatio-temporal composition  with a temporal one.  Further practical use cases with data conďŹguration guidance along real request/response examples will be presented  in the next section. In order to avoid confusion, from now  on we will refer to (geo)spatial CRSs as âs-CRSsâ, temporal  CRSs as ât-CRSsâ and compound spatio-temporal CRSs as  âst-CRSsâ.  < element name = " TemporalCRS "  type = " gml : TemporalCRSType "  s u b s t i t u t i o n G r o u p = " gml : A b s t r a c t S i n g l e C R S "/ >  < complexType name = " TemporalCRSType " >  < complexContent >  < extension base = " gml : AbstractCRSType " >  < sequence >  < choice >  < element ref = " gml : timeCS " / >  < element ref = " gml : usesTemporalCS "/ >  </ choice >  < element ref = " gml : temporalDatum " / >  </ sequence >  </ extension >  </ complexContent >  </ complexType >  Listing 5.  gml:TemporalCRSType.  < complexType name = " C o o r d i n a t e S y s t e m A x i s T y p e " >  < complexContent >  < extension  base = " gml : I d e n t i f i e d O b j e c t T y p e " >  < sequence >  < element ref = " gml : axisAbbrev " / >  < element ref = " gml : axisDirection " / >  < element ref = " gml : minimumValue "  minOccurs ="0"/>  < element ref = " gml : maximumValue "  minOccurs ="0"/>  < element ref = " gml : rangeMeaning "  minOccurs ="0"/>  </ sequence >  < attribute name = " uom " use = " required "  type = " gml : UomIdentifier " / >  </ extension >  </ complexContent >  </ complexType >  Listing 6.  gml:CoordinateSystemAxisType.  < complexType name = " T e m p o r a l D a t u m T y p e " >  < complexContent >  < extension  base = " gml : T e m p o r a l D a t u m B a s e T y p e " >  < sequence >  < element ref = " gml : origin " / >  </ sequence >  </ extension >  </ complexContent >  </ complexType >  Listing 7.  gml:TemporalDatumType.  V. P RACTICAL EXAMPLES  past, so that positive coordinates can be used (for example  in the case of geological time reference where is common  practice to use an unsigned numbers of millions of years as  meter).  In order to give full meaning to a temporal coordinate, it  must be linked to an absolute point in time by means of a  temporal datum (see Listing 7), just like a geodetic datum  binds a set of axes to an Earth model. In the simpler case,  the datum just needs to specify the origin of the temporal  CRS, which in the current version of GML is in the form  of an xsd:dateTime element, i.e. a concatenation of a date  and a timestamp separated by a literal letter â T â.  A ďŹrst straightforward use of the proposed framework  comes when serving a regularly spaced time series of  2D images. Nevertheless, the concept generally applies for  irregularly spaced series of n-dimensional features as well,  not necessarily having a linkage to a geodetic system of  coordinates (they could be medical CT scans as well, for  instance).  We can imagine to have several years of daily aggregates  of spectral projected images from a generic spaceborne  sensor over, say, Armenia and that we group them into a  single coverage named ARM-day-TS.

A visual example of the spatio-temporal gridded coverage  model applied to a time series of lidar vertical proďŹles from the CALIPSO  satellite mission (Cloud-Aerosol Lidar and Infrared PathďŹnder Satellite  Observations, NASA/CNES).  collection on N spectral observation over different frequency  channels and it has been mapped to UTM 38N cartesian  coordinates with the WGS84 datum. It should be noted how  the multispectral nature of the feature does not increase its  dimensionality, but rather its attribute space â known as  range in the GML nomenclature.  The spatio-temporal dimensionality of our dataset is then  three: two spatial axes â for which we can easily adopt the  predeďŹned UTM EPSG:32628 s-CRS â and one temporal  axis, which needs to be anchored to a proper t-CRS.  This will have an arbitrary origin and preferably daily  resolution, since we do not need ďŹner-grained time analysis  in this case. An example of temporal CRS is proposed in  Listing 8, which shows an hypothetical deďŹnition for the  ANSI date numbers, whose epoch dates back to January 1,  1601 (the beginning of the previous 400-year cycle of leap  years in the Gregorian calendar, which ended with the year  2000).  As a side note, despite the dimensionality of our proposed  grid coincides with the dimensionality of the encompassing  spatio-temporal space, this must not be meant as a ďŹxed rule:  more generally we can put any n-D feature inside an m-D  CRS space, as soon as n â¤ m, e.g. oblique 2D maps in the  3D space, trajectories in the 3D space, and so on. Moreover,  more one t-CRS could be anchored to th dataset, as could  be the case of 5D meteorological forecasts data-cubes [42].  The overall system of coordinates for our data could thus  be as showed in Listing 9, which in turn deďŹnes three axis:  the easting E and northing N, both deďŹned by the cartesian  CS of the UTM CRS, and the date t of the temporal CRS.  Having set up the metadata of our collection, we can then  published it in a machine-understandable way, so that a  client could read its description and then analyse it with  cross-sections (WCS/WCPS), request intra-spectral process-  Listing 8.  Example of gml:TemporalCRS.  ing operations, aggregate through time or space (WCPS),  etc.  As a practical example, a user might want to visualize  the ratio of two different channels over the whole available  spatial extent as a GeoTiff image, and this could be achieved  by the WCPS request showed in Listing 10.  In order to allow a user specify more meaningful  ISO 8601 time descriptions instead of time indexes, the use  of quotes could be adopted as switch: in the WCPS example  of Listing 10 then one could replace the ANSI date with its  equivalent in the Gregorian calendar, which would be the  glorious â2012-12-21â.  As a further example, one could exploit the GML encoding of a WCS response to retrieve the temporal series of  data over a certain time interval and for a speciďŹed Region of  Interest (RoI), like with the KVP-encoded request presented  in Listing 11. In this speciďŹc case, the request would then  return the desired result over our ARM-day-TS along with  a comprehensive description of the associated geometry,  optional descriptive metadata and data range types [43].  The WCS 2.0 upcoming CRS extension [44] could also be  exploited to retrieve data with more easily comprehensible  longitude/latitude degrees coordinates, but this goes beyond  the scope of this article.  137  123  { r e s o l v e r âp r e f i x } / d e f / crsâcompound?  1={ r e s o l v e r âp r e f i x } / d e f / c r s /EPSG/0/32638&  2={ r e s o l v e r âp r e f i x } / d e f / c r s /OGC/ 0 . 1 / ANSIâD  Listing 9.  < gmlcov : R e c t i f i e d G r i d C o v e r a g e  xmlns =[...] gml : id = " ID " >  < boundedBy >  < Envelope  srsName = " { resolver - prefix }/ crs - compound ?  1={ resolver - prefix }/ crs / EPSG /0/32638&  2={ resolver - prefix }/ crs / OGC /0.1/ ANSI - D "  axisLabels ="E N t"  uomLabels ="m m d"  srsDimension ="3">  < lowerCorner >  415000 4430000 149536  </ lowerCorner >  < upperCorner >  500000 4530000 149565  </ upperCorner >  </ Envelope >  </ boundedBy >  A spatio-temporal compound CRS.  f o r map i n (ARMâdayâTS )  return encode (  s l i c e ( map . 7 / map . 4 ,  { t (150470)} ) ,  â GTiff â )  Listing 10.

Listing 12 shows how this GML response would look like.  In the ďŹrst place, due to the regular spatio-temporal spacing  between the coverage points, the returned element would  be a gmlcov:RectifiedGridCoverage (though GML can  support more complex irregular and warped topologies as  well, see [45]).  The ďŹrst boundedBy section deďŹnes the Envelope, that is  the bounding box of the RoI, i.e. the one that was speciďŹed  in the userâs request (Listing 11), a posteriori of possible  trimmings over areas outside the coverage extent. This part  is optional in the response and its purpose is to provide a  direct transcription of the returned extent.  Afterwards, there is the gml:domainSet which describes  the topology of the retrieved data cube in much more detail,  allowing the client host to recover the position of each single  point of the dataset in both space and time.  As visible in both of these two blocks of GML, the stCRS deďŹned in Listing 9 is referenced here in the @srsName  attribute, with associated informative metadata regarding its  number of dimensions (@srsDimension), associated labels  (@axisLabel) and Units of Measure (UoM, @uomLabels)  for each axis in the st-CRS.  The indexes that appear inside the gml:GridEnvelope  element deďŹne the neutral index-based structure of the grid,  to describe its topology independently of the external st-CRS  onto which it is mapped.  The grid indexes shown in the example are meaningful  with respect to the WCS request in Listing. 11, and assume  that i) the entire source coverage spans the area (4 Âˇ 105 ,43 Âˇ  105 )Ă(5Âˇ105 ,46Âˇ105 ) [m2 ] in the projected geographic space  with a nominal resolution of 1Ă1 km2 , ii) the origin of the  time series is the 1st of January 2010 (ANSI date 149385),  < rangeSet >  < DataBlock >  < rangeParameters / >  < tupleList > [...] </ tupleList >  </ DataBlock >  </ rangeSet >  < rangeType > [...] </ rangeType >  </ gmlcov : R e c t i f i e d G r i d C o v e r a g e >  Listing 12.  GML description a spatio-temporal coverage.  and that iii) grid indexes of the complete topology start from  0.  The subsequent XML elements map the grid onto the  domain-aware space of the st-CRS. Firstly, the names âi  j kâ exposed in the axisLabels element are the labels  associated to the grid dimensions and should not be confused  with the labels listed in the @uomLabels attribute. Thinking  of a rotated grid into a cartesian coordinate system might  help distinguishing the two categories.  The offsetVector elements indeed denote the inherent  directional resolution for each one of the grid axis, by means  of a 3D tuple of coordinates â which ďŹt in the 3D st-CRS  â representing the endpoint of a vector starting from the  138  124  origin. The spatio-temporal location of each grid point can  then be recovered by starting from the origin and spanning  the coverage with the offset vectors.  In the proposed response, we can see that the resolution  is of 1000 km for the grid axes in the horizontal spatial  component of the st-CRS, while it is of 1 day along time.  In case of weekly aggregates instead, we would have had  the triplet {0,0,7} as offset vector along time.  It is again underlined that the UoMs associated with the  tuplesâ components in the offset vectors â and generally  for any coordinate listed in the response â can either be  read in the @uomLabels attributes or as well, if missing, in  the GML deďŹnitions of each single CRS (see @uom attribute  in Listing. 8).  To conclude, the actual payload of the response  (rangeSet) and its description (rangeType) were partially  hidden with ellipsis in the example since not relevant here.  A demo of the proposed framework has been implemented  and tested by means of Petascope â a Java implementation  of OGC standards and the reference implementation of  WCPS [46] â on top of the rasdaman Array DBMS [47].

C ONCLUSIONS  We have presented a framework for Web services that  enables a valid OGC-compliant embedding of time as a  dimension into the coverage models offered by the GML  schema deďŹnitions.  The proposed model uses existing gml:TemporalCRS  elements to augment the coordinate reference system (CRS)  of a coverage from purely spatial to spatio-temporal; it can  be generally applied to arbitrary time scales and resolutions,  and the overall system complexity is relatively low.  The use of URIs as policy for CRSs referencing completes  the picture of a coherent automated system, with no need of  out-of-band handling of the temporal dimension.  Particular attention was put on the practical application of  the framework to the OGC WCS and WCPS services, and  concrete request/response examples were described. These  examples were also successfully implemented and tested  over a Java-servlet/Array-DBMS architecture.  The proposed framework â under discussion by the OGC  consortium [48] â makes a step forward towards an open  interconnectedness and interoperability of Web services for  spatio-temporal coverages. Forthcoming applications in the  context of the European EarthServer project [49] will accelerate further evaluation and testing phases, and will represent  lighthouse services for the access and elaboration of time  series of scientiďŹc datasets.
