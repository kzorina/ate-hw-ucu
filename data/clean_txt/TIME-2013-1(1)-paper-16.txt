In fact, the set of reachable states of the TPN is generally  infinite due to the infinite number of time successors a  given state could have. Two main approaches are used to  treat this state space: region graphs [1] and the state class  approach [3]. The other methods [2], [21], [4], [9], [5], [14],  [6], [10] are either refinements or improvements of these  basic approaches. The objective of these representations is  to yield a state-space partition that groups concrete states  into sets of states with similar behaviour with respect to the  properties to be verified. These sets of states must cover  the entire state space and must be finite in order to ensure  the termination of the verification process. In this work,  we propose a new contribution for the abstraction and the  verification of finite TPN-based timed systems.  This paper is organised as follows: In Section II, some  preliminaries about TPNs and the corresponding semantics  are recalled. In Section III, we define the Timed Aggregate Graph (TAG) associated with a TPN and we discuss  the main preservation results of the TAG-based approach.  Section IV relates our work to existing approaches. In  Section V, we discuss the experimental results obtained  with our implementation compared to two well-known tools,  namely Romeo [8] and TINA [5]. Finally, a conclusion and  some perspectives are given in Section VI.  AbstractâTime Petri nets (TPN model) allow the specification of real-time systems involving explicit timing constraints.  The main challenge of the analysis of such systems is to  construct, with few resources (time and space), a coarse  abstraction preserving timed properties. In this paper, we  propose a new finite graph, called Timed Aggregate Graph  (TAG), abstracting the behaviour of bounded TPNs with strong  time semantics. The main feature of this abstract representation  compared to existing approaches is the encoding of the time  information. This is done in a pure way within each node of  the TAG allowing to compute the minimum and maximum  elapsed time in every path of the graph. The TAG preserves  runs and reachable states of the corresponding TPN and allows  for verification of both event- and state-based properties.  Keywords-Real Time Systems; Time Petri Nets; State Space  Abstraction; Model Checking of Timed Properties;  I. I NTRODUCTION  Time Petri nets are one of the most used formal models for  the specification and the verification of systems where the  explicit consideration of time is essential, such as communication protocols, circuits, or real-time systems. The main  extensions of Petri nets with time are time Petri nets [15]  and timed Petri nets [19]. In the first, a transition can fire  within a time interval whereas, in the second, time durations  can be assigned to the transitions; tokens are meant to spend  that time as reserved in the input places of the corresponding  transitions. Several variants of timed Petri nets exist: time  is either associated with places (p-timed Petri nets), with  transitions (t-timed Petri nets) or with arcs (a-timed Petri  nets) [20]. The same holds for time Petri nets [7]. In [18],  the authors prove that p-timed Petri nets and t-timed Petri  nets have the same expressive power and are less expressive  than time Petri nets. Several semantics have been proposed  for each variant of these models. Here we focus on t-time  Petri nets, which we simply call TPNs. There are two ways  of letting the time elapse in a TPN [18]. The first way,  known as the Strong Time Semantics (STS), is defined in  such a manner that time elapsing cannot disable a transition.  Hence, when the upper bound of a firing interval is reached,  the transition must be fired. In contrast, the Weak Time  Semantics (WTS) does not make any restriction on the  elapsing of time.  For real-time systems, the dense time model (where time  is considered in the domain RâĽ0 ) is the only possible option,  1530-1311/13 $26.00 ÂŠ 2013 IEEE  1550-1311/13  DOI 10.1109/TIME.2013.22  Laure Petrucci  UniversiteĚ Paris 13, Sorbonne Paris CiteĚ  LIPN, CNRS UMR, France  laure.petrucci@lipn.univ-paris13.fr  II. P RELIMINARIES  AND  BASIC N OTATIONS  A t-time Petri net (TPN) is a P/T Petri net [17] where a  time interval [tmin ;tmax ] is associated with each transition t.  Definition 1: A TPN is a tuple N = P, T, Pre, Post, I  where:  â˘ P, T, Pre, Post is a P/T Petri net where:  â P is a finite set of places;  â T is a finite set of transitions with P âŠ T = 0/ ;  â Pre : T ââ NP is the backward incidence mapping;  â Post : T ââ NP is the forward incidence mapping;  â˘ I : T ââ N Ă (N âŞ {+â}) is a time interval function s.t.  I(t) = (tmin ,tmax ) (tmin â¤ tmax ), where tmin (resp. tmax ) is  the earliest (resp. latest) firing time of transition t.  A marking of a TPN is a function m : P ââ N where m(p),  for a place p, denotes the number of tokens in p. A marked  TPN is a pair N = N 1 , m0  where N 1 is a TPN and m0 is  103  117  a corresponding initial marking. A transition t is enabled by  a marking m iff m âĽ Pre(t) and Enable(m) = {t â T : m âĽ  Pre(t)} denotes the set of enabled transitions in m. If a transition ti is enabled by a marking m, then â(m,ti ) denotes the  set of newly enabled transitions [2]. Formally, â(m,ti ) = {t â  T | (mâPre(ti )+Post(ti )) âĽ Pre(t)â§(mâPre(ti )) < Pre(t)}.  If a transition t is in â(m,ti ), we say that t is newly enabled  by the successor of m by firing ti . Dually, â(m,ti ) = {t â T |  (m â Pre(ti ) + Post(ti )) âĽ Pre(t) â§ (m â Pre(ti )) âĽ Pre(t)} is  the set of oldly enabled transitions. The possibly infinite  set of reachable markings of N is denoted Reach(N ). If  Reach(N ) is finite we say that N is bounded.  The semantics of TPNs can be given in terms of Timed  Transition Systems (TTS) [12] which are usual transition  systems with two types of labels: discrete labels for events  (transitions) and positive real labels for time elapsing (delay). States of the TTS are pairs s = (m,V ) where m is a  marking and V : T ââ RâĽ0 âŞ {âĽ} a time valuation. In the  following, s.m and s.V denote the marking and the time  valuation respectively of a state s. If a transition t is enabled  in m then V (t) is the elapsed time since t became enabled,  otherwise V (t) = âĽ. Given a state s = (m,V ) and a transition  t, t is said to be firable in s iff t â Enable(m) â§ V (t) =  âĽ â§ tmin â¤ V (t) â¤ tmax .  Definition 2 (Semantics of a TPN): Let N = P, T, Pre,  Post, I, m0  be a marked TPN. The semantics of N is a TTS  S N = Q, s0 , â where:  1) Q is a (possibly infinite) set of states  2) s0 = (m0 ,V0 ) is the initial state such that:    0  if t â Enable(m0 )  ât â T, V0 (t) =  âĽ otherwise  transition must fire within its firing interval unless disabled  by the firing of others. Second, a state change occurs either  by the firing of transitions or by time elapsing: The firing  of a transition may change the current marking while the  time elapsing may make some new transitions firable. When  a deadlock marking is reached, then only elapsing time is  possible and the system remains in the same state.  Given a TPN N and the corresponding TTS S N , a path  Îą1  Îą2  s1 ââ  . . . , where Îąi â (T âŞ RâĽ0 ), is a run of  Ď = s0 ââ  S N iff (si , Îąi , si+1 ) ââ for each i = 0, 1, . . . . The length  of a run Ď can be infinite and is denoted by | Ď |. The  possibly infinite set of runs of S N is denoted [S N ]. Without  loss of generality, we assume that for each non empty run  Îą1  Îą2  Ď = s0 ââ  s1 ââ  . . . of a STS corresponding to a TPN, there  do not exist two successive labels Îąi and Îąi+1 belonging  both to RâĽ0 . Then, Ď can be written, involving the reachable  (d1 ,t1 )  (d2 ,t2 )  m1 ââ  . . . where di is the  markings of N , as Ď = m0 ââ  time elapsed at marking miâ1 before firing ti . In order to  associate a run Ď of S N with a run of N , denoted P (Ď), we  define the following projection function, where  denotes the  concatenation operator between paths and Ďi , for i = 0, 1 . . . ,  denotes the suffix of Ď starting at state si .  â§  s0 .m  if | Ď |= 0  âŞ  âŞ  âŞ  â¨ s .m(0,Îą1 )  P (Ď1 )  if Îą1 â T  ââ  0  P (Ď) =  (Îą1 ,Îą2 )  2  âŞ  s0 .m ââ  P (Ď ) if Îą1 â RâĽ0 â§ | Ď |âĽ 2  âŞ  âŞ  âŠ  Îą1   P (Ď1 )  if Îą1 â RâĽ0 â§ | Ď |= 1  s0 .mââ  3) â â Q Ă (T âŞ RâĽ0 ) Ă Q is the discrete and continuous  transition relations:  a) the discrete transition relation:  t  ât â T : (m,V ) â  â (m ,V  ) iff:  In this subsection, we propose to abstract the reachability  state space of a TPN using a new graph called Timed  Aggregate Graph (TAG) where nodes are called aggregates  and are grouping sets of states of a TTS. The key idea  behind TAGs is that time information is encoded inside  aggregates. The time information includes the time the  system is able to stay in the aggregate as well as a dynamic  interval associated with each enabled transition. The first  feature allows to encapsulate the delay transitions of the  corresponding TTS (the arcs of a TAG are labeled with  transitions of the corresponding TPN only), while the second  allows to dynamically update the earliest and latest firing  times of enabled transitions. It also allows to maintain the  relative differences between the firing times of transitions  (diagonal constraints).  Before we formally define the TAG and illustrate how the  attributes of an aggregate are computed, let us first formally  define aggregates.  Definition 3 (Timed Aggregate): A timed aggregate associated with a TPN N = P, T, Pre, Post, I is a 4-tuple  a = (m, E, h, H), where:  â˘ m is a marking;  III.

The above definition requires some comments. First, the  delay transitions respect the STS semantics: an enabled  118  104  p1  p2  t1 [1; 2]  t2 [1; 1]  p1  â˘  â˘  p3  t1 [1; 1] t2 [2; 2] t3 [0; 1]  Figure 1.  â˘  p2  p1  p2  t1 [1; 2]  t2 [2;â]  3) Î´ â A Ă T Ă A is the transition relation such that:  for an aggregate a = m, h, H, E, a transition t s.t.  t, Îąt , Î˛t  â E and an aggregate a = m , h , H  , E  ,  (a,t, a ) â Î´ iff the following holds:  a) m = m â Pre(t) + Post(t)  b) Îąt â¤ H  c) ât  , Îąt  , Î˛t   â E,     â Îą  ) âĽ (t  tmin > tmax  â (tmin â Îąt ) â (tmin  min â  t   )  tmax  d) E  = E1 S  âŞ E2 , where:     ,t  }  â˘ E1 = t  ââ(a,t) {t  ,tmin  max  S      â˘ E2 = t  ââ(a,t) {t , Îąt  â H, Î˛t  â max(0, Îąt )}  e) h = mint  ,Îąt  ,Î˛t  âE  (max(0, Îąt  ))  f) H  = mint  ,Îąt  ,Î˛t  âE  (Î˛t  )  Given an aggregate a = m, h, H, E and a transition t â  t  T , t is said to be enabled by a, denoted by aââ  , iff: (1)  â(Îąt , Î˛t ) â (Z âŞ {ââ}) Ă (N âŞ {+â}) s.t. (t, Îąt , Î˛t ) â E and  Îąt â¤ H, and, (2) there is no other transition t  , enabled by  a.m, that should be fired before t. In fact, the first condition  is sufficient if the static interval of t overlaps with any other  transitionâs interval but is not sufficient when tmin is greater    than tmax  for some other transition t  . The firing of t from a  leads to a new aggregate a = m , h , H  , E   whose attributes  are computed by analysing the sets â (a,t) and â (a,t). This  is the key idea behind the TAG.    â˘ The elements of E are processed by taking the transitions that are enabled by m and computing their  earliest and latest firing times depending on their membership in â (a,t) and â (a,t). For each transition t  â  Enable(a.m), if t  is newly enabled, then its dynamic  earliest and latest firing times are statically defined by      tmin  and tmax  respectively. Otherwise, let t  , Îąt  , Î˛t   â    a.E and t , Îąt , Î˛t  â a .E, then the maximum time  elapsed by the system at a.m (i.e., a.H) is subtracted  from Îąt  and the minium time is substracted from Î˛t  .  Indeed, the more the system can stay in a.m the less  it can stay in a .m (and vice versa). Thus, the earliest  firing time of t starting from a is max(0, Îąt  â a.H)  while its latest firing time is Î˛t  â max(0, Îąt ).  â˘ The computation of a .h (resp. a .H) is ensured by  taking the minimum of the dynamic earliest (resp.  latest) firing time of enabled transitions.  Three TPN Examples  E = {t, Îąt , Î˛t  | t â Enable(m), Îąt â (Z âŞ {ââ}) â§  Î˛t â N âŞ {+â}} is a set of enabled transitions each  asssociated with two time values;  h = mint,Îąt ,Î˛t âE (max(0, Îąt )): the minimum time the  system can stay in the aggregate a;  H = mint,Îąt ,Î˛t âE (Î˛t ): the maximum time the system  can stay in the aggregate a.  Each aggregate is characterised by three attributes that are  computed dynamically: a marking m, a set E of enabled  transitions and two times h and H. Each enabled transition  t is associated with two time values: Îąt represents the  minimum time the system should wait before firing t and  Î˛t represents the maximum time the system can delay the  firing of t. Note that Îąt can be negative which means that  t can be fired immediately. Otherwise, Îąt represents the  the earliest firing time of t. Starting from this aggregate,  the firing of t can occur between max(0, Îąt ) and H. In the  rest of this paper, Îąt will be abusively called the dynamic  earliest firing time of t and Î˛t its dynamic latest firing time.  Finally, the h and H attributes represent the minimum and  the maximum time, respectively, the system can spend at the  current aggregate.  As for states of a TTS, the attributes of an aggregate a  are denoted by a.m, a.E, a.h and a.H.  Now, we are ready to formally define the TAG associated  with a marked TPN N . A TAG is a labeled transition system  where nodes are timed aggregates. A TAG has an initial  aggregate, a set of actions (the set of transitions of N ) and a  transition relation. The initial aggregate is easily computed  by considering static information of the TPN. In fact: (1)  the marking attribute is the initial marking of N , (2) the  minimum (resp. maximum) time the system can stay in the  initial aggregate is equal to the minimum of the earliest  (resp. latest) firing time of the enabled transitions and, (3)  each enabled transition t is firable between tmin and tmax .  Definition 4 (Timed Aggregate Graph): A TAG associated with a TPN N = P, T, Pre, Post, I, m0  is a tuple  G = A , T, a0 , Î´ where:  1) A is a set of timed aggregates;  2) a0 = m0 , h0 , H0 , E0  is the initial timed aggregate s.t. :  a) m0 is the initial marking of N  b) h0 = mintâEnable(m0 ) (tmin )  c) H0 = mintâEnable(m0 ) (tmax )  d) E0 = {t,tmin ,tmax  | t â Enable(m0)}  B. Equivalence relation between aggregates  According to Definition 4, the dynamic earliest firing time  of a transition can decrease infinitely which could lead to  an infinite state space TAG. In the following, we define  a relation allowing to identify equivalent aggregates. This  equivalence relation will be used in the construction of a  TAG so that each newly built aggregate is not explored as  long as an already built equivalent aggregate has been.  Definition 5: Let a and a be two time aggregates. a is  said to be equivalent to a , denoted by a âĄ a , iff:  119  105  1) a.h = a .h, a.H = a .H and a.m = a .m  2) â(t, Îąt , Î˛t , t, Îąt , Î˛t ) â (a.E Ă a .E), Î˛t = Î˛t :  a0  aggregate  a0  a1  a2  a3  a4  a5  a) Îąt = Îąt or,  b) max(0, Îąt ) = max(0, Îąt ) and  i)  ii)  iii)  iv)  t     (tmax   ) or,  âT :  < tmin ) â¨ (tmax < tmin     ) or,  ât â (T \ Enable(a.m)) : (tmax < tmin      ât â (T \ Enable(a.m)) : tmax < tmin â§   ) â§ (Îą â¤ t  ) or,  (Îąt â¤ tmax  t  max    ât  â Enable(a.m) : tmax  < tmin â§     ) â§ (Îą â Îą )  ((Îąt â Îąt  ) â¤ (tmax  â tmin  t  t      (tmax  â tmin  )) â¨ ((Îąt  â Îąt ) = (Îąt â Îąt )).

First, point 1  guarantees that a and a have the same marking and the same  minimum and maximum stay time. Second, each enabled  transition t should have the same latest firing time (point 2).  Then, if the earliest firing time of a given enabled transition  t in a is different from its earliest firing time in a , then  this should not influence the future behavior starting from  a and a . First, the earliest firing times of t in a and a  must be negative so that the firing of t from a and a do  not lead to different aggregates. This condition is sufficient    if there is no transition t  such that tmax  < tmin (point 2(b)i),      or if any transition t s.t. tmax < tmin is not enabled by a  (point 2(b)ii). In the opposite case, other conditions must  be fulfilled: First, if there exists a transition t  such that    tmax  < tmin but t  is not enabled by a (point 2(b)iii), then    Îąt and Îąt should be both less or equal to tmax  (i.e. t is  firable anyway in both aggregates). Second, if t  is enabled  by a (point 2(b)iv), either t is firable by both aggregates a   â Îą  ) is equal to  and a or the difference (tmin â Îąt ) â (tmin  t        (tmin â Îąt ) â (tmin â Îąt  ).  Figure 2 illustrates the TAGs corresponding to the first  and the third TPNs of Figure 1. The TAG associated with  the second TPN contains 18 aggregates and 38 edges, and is  not presented here because of lack of space. In the first TAG,  the marking associated with aggregates is omitted since it  is always the same as the initial one. Although, the three  models of Figure 1 are quite simple, they are representative  enough to explain the TAG construction. Indeed, in the  first one the transitions intervals overlap, while the case of  disjoint intervals is considered through the second model.  Finally, the third model illustrates the case of an infinite  latest firing time. More significant examples are considered  in Section V.  In the following, we establish that the TAG, built under the  previous equivalence relation between aggregates, associated  with a bounded TPN is finite. For this, we show that the  number of its aggregates is bounded and compute this bound.  The following two lemmas establish two preliminary results  before proving the finiteness of a TAG in Theorem 1.  Lemma 1: Let N be a TPN and let G = A , T, a0 , Î´  be the corresponding TAG. Let a be an aggregate of G  marking  (1,1)  (1,0)  (1,0)  (1,1)  (1,0)  (h,H)  (1,2)  (0,0)  (1,2)  (0,2)  (0,2)  E  {t1 , 1, 2, t2 , 2, â}  {t1 , â1, 0}  {t1 , 1, 2}  {t1 , 1, 2, t2 , 0, â}  {t1 , â1, 2}  Figure 2.  t2  t2  t1  t1  a2  a4  a1  a0  t1  t1  t1  a3  t2  a4  TAGs of Figure 1  and let t â Enable(a.m). Then, the number of possible  dynamic intervals [Îąt ; Î˛t ] associated with t in non equivalent  aggregates is at most equal to Bt where      if t  â T : tmax  < tmin  bt  Bt =  bt â ct otherwise  where bt = (tmin + 1)â (tmax + 1)â (tmin + (tmin â (tmin + 1)/2))   )+1   <t  and ct = Maxt  âT : tmax  (t â tmax  min min  Proof: The possible intervals are obtained by all the  possible combinations of the earliest and latest firing times  Îąt and Î˛t , minus the invalid ones (i.e. those where Îąt > Î˛t  and those where Îąt = tmin â§ Îąt = Î˛t ). In the first case, we    consider that there is no transition t  such that tmax  < tmin .  Since negative values of Îąt are equivalent to 0 the possible  values of Îąt are {tmin ,tmin â 1, . . . , 0} (i.e tmin + 1 possible  values). Moreover, Î˛t â {tmax ,tmax â 1, . . . , 0} (i.e tmax + 1  possible values) and there are tmin + (tmin â (tmin + 1)/2)  invalid intervals. The first tmin intervals are invalid by  construction of the TAG since Î˛t can never reach Îąt by  decrement (Îą < H). Moreover, there are (tmin â (tmin + 1)/2)  intervals where Îąt > Î˛t , and these are invalid as well. In the  second case, the previous reasoning is also valid, but one has  to consider the difference between t and t  . Following the  definition of the equivalence relation between aggregates,  this difference is ignored when it allows the firing of t.    Thus, only tmin â tmax  + 1 values are to be distinguished (for      t having the minimal tmax  < tmin ) and should be combined  with the number of possibilities obtained in the first case.  Lemma 2: Let N be a TPN, let G = A , T, a0 , Î´ be the  corresponding TAG and let m â Reach(N ). The number of  aggregates in G having m as marking is at most equal to  âsâ2Enable(m) (âtâs Bt ).  Proof: Let m be a marking, the number of aggregates  having m as a marking are different with respect to the E  attribute. There are as many possibilities of partitionning  enabled transitions into oldly and newly enabled as subset  of Enable(m). For a given subset s of Enable(m) there are  at most âtâs Bt (using Lemma 1) possible time intervals for  120  106  Î˛l+1tn+1 âĽ 0, thus Îąl+1tn+1 â¤ Î˛l+1tn+1 . By iterating this  result we establish that Îąntn+1 â¤ Î˛ntn+1 and that Î˛ntn+1 âĽ  0. Moreover, it is clear that Î˛iâ1tn+1 âĽ Î˛itn+1 (for all  i = l + 1 . . . n). In particular, we have 0 â¤ Îąntn+1 â¤  Î˛ntn+1 â¤ Î˛nâ1tn+1 â¤ Âˇ Âˇ Âˇ â¤ Î˛ltn+1 = tn+1max . Thus, the  system can stay at mn for Îąntn+1 . Furthermore, the fact  that tn+1 is firable at an implies that it is also firable  in mn leading to mn+1 , whose marking is the same as  an+1. Let us show now that it is possible to stay at  mn+1 for an+1 .H (or any d â¤ an+1 .H) time units. We  can use the same reasoning as above to show that for  any transiton t enabled by mn+1 , Îąn+1t â¤ tmax . Since  an+1.H = mintâEnable(mn+1 ) Î˛t we can deduce that the  system can stay at mn+1 an+1.H (or any lower value)  time units.  its transitions.  The two previous lemmas lead to the following theorem.  Theorem 1: Given a TPN N , if N is bounded then the  corresponding TAG is finite and its number of aggregates is  at most equal to âmâReach(N ) âsâ2Enable(m) âtâEnable(m) Bt .  C. Preservation Results  In this section, we establish the main results of this paper:  The TAG is an exact representation of the reachability state  space of a TPN. For each path in the TAG (resp. in the  TPN) it is possible to find a path in the TPN (resp. TAG)  involving the same sequence of transitions and where the  time elapsed within a given state is between the minimum  and the maximum stay time of the corresponding aggregate.

Since an .m = mn and dn+1 â¤ an .H, tn+1 is also enabled  by an (by construction) and can be fired leading to an+1  whose marking is the same as mn+1 . Let us now show  that dn+2 â¤ an+1.H. If Enable(mn+1) = 0/ then mn+1 is a  deadlock state and so is an+1 and dn+1 < an+1 .H = +â.  Otherwise, let t â Enable(mn+1) let 1 â¤ k â¤ n + 1 be  the largest integer, satisfying t ââ (mk ,tk+1 ).

By proving that di âĽ Îąiti+1 for all  i = k . . . n, we can deduce that dn+1 â¤ tmax â âni=k Îąiti+1 =  Î˛n+1t . This result holds for any enabled transition t  then dn+1 â¤ mintâEnable(mn+1 ) (Î˛n+1t ) = an+1 .H. Finally,  let us prove that di âĽ Îąiti+1 for all i = k . . . n.

We show now that  it is possible to complete this path by firing tn+1 from  mn (after a delay Îąntn+1 at this state). Note first that tn+1  is enabled by mn (since mn = an .m).  Let l (with l < n) be the greatest integer, such that  tn+1 ââ (alâ1 ,tl ), then tn+1 ,tn+1min ,tn+1max  â al .E.

We know by construction that Îąiâ1ti â¤  aiâ1 .H (condition for firing ti at aiâ1 ) (for all i =  l + 1 . . . n). Using the fact that Îąltn+1 â¤ Î˛ltn+1 and  the fact that Îąltl+1 â¤ al .H â¤ Î˛ltn+1 , we can deduce  that Îąltn+1 â al .H â¤ Î˛l+1tn+1 = (Î˛ltn+1 â Îąltl+1 ) and that  121  107  mi ) which means that di âĽ ti+1min â âiâ1  j=l d j .

Lime and Roux also used  TPNs to model system behavior [14]. They used the state  class approach to build a timed automaton that preserves  the behaviour of the TPN using as few clock variables as  possible. The resulting model is then verified using the  UPPAAL tool [13]. However, even though UPPAAL can  answer about quantitative temporal properties, it can only  verify a subset of TCTL. Adding a new transition to measure  elapsed time was proposed in [6] to perform TCTL modelchecking in TPNs. Using this transition, TCTL formulae  are translated into CTL formulae. Then a ZBG for TPN is  refined leading to a graph called Atomic Zone Based Graph  (AZBG) that preserves CTL properties.  Unlike the TAG, in all existing approaches, the time  information does not appear explicitly in nodes. This limitation, in turn leads to additional and complex calculations  such as: the manipulation of DBM to encode the zones  (for zones-based approaches) and the classes (for stateclass based approaches), the approximations to counter the  problem of unbounded transitions, conversion of graphs to  timed automata (using UPPAAL) to model check properties,  etc. In our work the time information is encoded within  the aggregates allowing to check time properties just by  browsing the graph, which has a significant impact on  the construction complexity. The encoding of the timing  information in the aggregates is such that the minimum and  maximum elapsed time in every path of the TAG can be  computed. Another difference with these approaches is that  every TAG preserves the runs of the corresponding TPNs as  well as the reachable states, which allows the preservation  of both event- and state-based (linear and branching) logics.  Using the above result one can use the TAG associated  with a TPN in order to analyse both event and state based  properties. In particular, we can check whether a given  marking (resp. transition) is reachable (resp. is firable) before  (or after) a some time.  IV. R ELATED WORK  This section reviews the most well-known techniques,  proposed in the literature, that abstract and analyse the state  space of real-time systems described by means of TPN.  Abstraction techniques aim at constructing, by removing  some irrelevant details, a contraction of the state space  of the model, which preserves properties of interest. The  existing abstraction approaches mainly differ in the state  agglomeration criteria, the characterisation of states and  state classes (interval states or clock states) and the kind  of preserved properties.  The States Class Graph (SCG) [3] was the first method  of state space representation adapted to TPNs. A class  (m, D) is associated with a marking m and a time domain  D represented by a set of inequalities over variables. The  variables represented in the SCG are the firing time intervals  of enabled transitions. The SCG allows for the verification  of some TPN properties like reachability and boundness.  However, it preserves the linear time properties only. To  address this limitation, a refinement of the method was  proposed in [21], in the form of a graph called Atomic  States Class Graph (ASCG). The authors use a cutting of  state class by adding linear constraints so that each state  of an atomic class has a successor in all the following  classes. With this improvement, they are able to verify  CTLâ properties on TPN, but with the limitation that the  time intervals of transitions are bounded. A new approach  for the construction of atomic classes was proposed in [4]  and allows the verification of CTLâ without restriction on  time intervals. The state class approach is implemented in a  software tool called TINA [5].  The Zones Based Graph (ZBG) [9] is another approach  allowing to abstract the TPN state space. This approach is  inspired by the Region Graph (RG) [1] technique, initially  introduced for timed automata. In practice, the number of  regions is too large for an effective analysis, thus, the regions  are grouped into a set of zones. A zone is a convex union  of regions and can be represented by a DBM (Difference  Bound Matrix). In [9], the clocks of transitions are directly  encoded within the zones. This allows to verify temporal and  quantitative properties but not CTLâ properties. As for timed  automata, a disadvantage of the method is the necessary  recourse to approximation methods (k-approximation or kxapproximation) in the case where the infinity is used in  V. E XPERIMENTAL RESULTS  Our approach for building TAG-TPN was implemented in  a prototype tool (written in C++), and used for experiments  in order to validate the sizes of the graphs generated by  the approach. Note that the prototype was not optimised for  time efficiency yet, therefore no timing figures are given  in this section. All results reported in this section have  been obtained on 2.8 gigahertz Intel with four gigabytes  of RAM. The implemented prototype allowed us to have  first comparison with existing approaches with respect to  the size of obtained graphs. We used the TINA tool to build  the SCGs, ROMEO tool for the ZBGs and our tool for  the TAGs. We tested our approach on several TPN models  and we report here the obtained results. The considered  models are representative of the characteristics that may  occur in a TPN, such as: concurrency, synchronisation,  disjoint firing intervals and infinite firing bounds. The first  two models (Figure 3(a) and Figure 3(b)) are two parametric  models where the number of processes can be increased.  In Figure 3(a), the number of self loops (pn â tn â pn )  is increased while in Figure 3(b) the number of processes,  122  108  Parameters  Nb. prod/cons  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  10  Nb. self-loops  1  2  3  4  5  Nb. processes  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  Nb. processes  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  SCG (with Tina)  (nodes / arcs)  ZBG (with Romeo)  TAG-TPN  (nodes / arcs)  (nodes / arcs)  TPN model of producer/consumer  34 / 56  34 / 56  34 / 56  748 / 2460  593 / 1 922  407 / 1 255  4 604 / 21891  3 240 / 15 200  1 618 / 6 892  14 086 / 83 375  9 504 / 56 038  3 972 / 20 500  31 657 / 217 423  20 877 / 145 037  8 175 / 48 351  61 162 / 471 254  39 306 / 311 304  15 157 / 99 539  107 236 / 907 708  67 224 / 594 795  26 113 / 186 363  175 075 / 1 604 319  107 156 / 1 044 066  42 503 / 324 600  270 632 / 2 655 794  161 874 / 1 718 104  66 103 / 534 055  400 648 / 4 175 413  234 398 / 2 687 147  99 036 / 839 011  TPN example with concurrency (Figure 3(a))  39 / 72  40 / 74  39 / 72  471 / 1 296  472 / 1 299  354 / 963  6 735 / 25 056  6 736 / 25 060  2 745 / 9 888  119 343 / 563 040  119 344 / 563 045  19 488 / 87 375  2 546 679 / 14 564 016  ?/?  130 911 / 701 748  TPN example with synchronization (Figure 3(b))  1/2  2/4  1/2  13 / 35  14 / 38  13 / 35  157 / 553  158 / 557  118 / 409  2 245 / 10 043  2 246 / 10 048  915 / 3 909  3 9781 / 21 7681  39 782 / 217 687  6 496 / 33 071  848 893 / 5 495 603  848 894 / 5 495 610  43 637 / 258 051  ?/?  ?/?  282 514 / 1.90282e+06  Fischer protocol  4/4  4/4  4/4  18 / 29  19 / 32  20 / 32  65 / 146  66 / 153  80 / 171  220 / 623  221 / 652  308 / 808  727 / 2 536  728 / 2 615  1 162 / 3 645  2 378 / 9 154  2 379 / 10 098  4 274 / 15 828  7 737 / 24 744  7 738 / 37 961  15 304 / 66 031  25 080 / 102 242  25 081 / 139 768  53 480 / 265 040  Table I  E XPERIMENTATION RESULTS  whose behavior is either local, by transition ti , or global, by  transition t0 , is increased.  In addition to these two illustrative examples, we used two  other well known parametric TPN models. The first one [11]  represents a composition of producer/consumer models by  fusion of a single buffer (of size 5). The second (adapted  from [16]) is Fischerâs protocol for mutual exclusion.  for the producers/consumers models show that the TAG  yields better abstraction (linear order) than the SCG and  the ZBG approaches. Each time a new module of producer/consumer is introduced, the size of graphs increases  for all three approaches. However, the TAG achieves a better  performance than the two other approaches. For the TPN of  Figure 3(a), the obtained results show that the size of the  TAG exponentially increases when the parallelism occurs  in the structure of TPN. This is also the case also for the  ZBG and the SCG methods, and we can see that our method  behaves better when we increment the self-loop structures  in the model. The ZBGâs and the SCGâs executions have  aborted due to a lack of memory when the number of selfloops was equal to 5. The number of edges of the obtained  graphs follows the same proportion. In the synchronisation  pattern exmaple, our approach also behaves. Indeed, with,  1, 2 and 3 processes, the sizes of the obtained graphs  are almost similar with the three approaches. But, from  4 synchronised processes, the size of the SCGs and the  ZBGs increase exponentially, leading to a state explosion  with 7 processes, whereas the TAGs have been computed  p1  p4  t1 [1; 5]  p5  p1  t3 [1; 5]  p2  p3  p2  t0 [1; 5]  t4 [1; 5] t5 [1; 5]  t2 [1; 5]  t1 [1; 5]  (a) concurrency  (b) synchronisation  Figure 3.  t2 [1; 5]  TPN models used in the experiments  Table I reports the results obtained with the SCG, the  ZBG and the TAG-TPN approaches, in terms of graph size  (number of nodes/number of edges). The obtained results  123  109  successfully with 7 processes (and even more). The Fischer  protocol model is the only model where our approach leads  to relatively bad results (although the difference with the two  other approaches is linear). Our first explanation is that, in  case of disjoint firing intervals, the abstraction can be weak  in some cases. In fact, when a transition t is enabled by  an aggregate t and there exists a transition t  , not enabled   , a is considered non-equivalent (while  by a, s.t. tmin > tmax  it could be) to all aggregates where the earliest firing time  of t is not the same. However, it could be that t and t  are  never enabled simultanously, in which case the difference  does not play any role. This issue should be investigated in  order to refine our abstraction (e.g. by taking into account  the structure of the TPN model).  To conclude, the experimental results show (in most cases)  an important gain in performance in terms of graph size  (nodes/arcs) compared to the SCG and the ZBG approaches  for the tested examples. Although we are aware that our  approach needs to be confronted to more significant applications, the obtained preliminary results are promising.  [5] B. Berthomieu and F. Vernadat.

The proposed graph, called TAG,  produces a finite representation of the bounded TPN behaviour and allows for analysing timed reachability properties. Unlike the existing approaches, our abstraction can  be directly used to check both state and event-based logic  properties. Our ultimate goal is to use the TAG traversal  algorithm for the verification of timed reachability properties  expressed in the TCTL logic. Several issues have to be  explored in the future: We first have to carry out additional  experimentation (using more significant use cases) to better  understand the limits of our approach and to better compare  the TAG technique to the existing approaches. Second, we  believe that the size of the TAG can be further reduced while  preserving time properties without necessarily preserving all  the paths of the underlying TPN. We also plan to design and  implement model checking algorithms for full TCTL logic.  [12] K. G. Larsen, P. Pettersson, and W. Yi. Model-checking for  real-time systems.
