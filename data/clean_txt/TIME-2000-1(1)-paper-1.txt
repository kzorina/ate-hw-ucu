A Formalization of Structured Temporal Objects and  Repetition  Diana Cukierman and James Delgrande  Abstract. We propose an approach to formally representing structured temporal objects. These new temporal objects are recursively  made up of convex intervals and Allenâs convex relations. The major emphasis in our approach is on temporal repetition. To that effect  we define the time loop. Time loops allow us to abstract common  elements in repetitive temporal patterns. A loop is essentially parameterized by a cycle which is a structured temporal element possibly  including subloops, a relation between instances of the cycle and a  repetitions number. Atemporal assertions are true during these temporal objects, and thus this formalism allows one to concisely represent and reason with assertions which have an inherent temporal  structure. Hence, this formalism allows one to concisely represent,  for example, the scheduling of regular meetings in a university, where  a meeting may in turn be composed of structured temporal elements.  1  Introduction  We propose an approach based on convex interval relations [1] to formally representing structured temporal objects. The simplest structured temporal object is a related pair, consisting of two temporal  objects with some (interval) relation between them. As well, we have  sets of related pairs and time loops. Our primary object of interest is  the time loop, used to represent temporal repetition. Atemporal assertions are true during these temporal objects.  The key contribution of this formalism is that we propose a language that treats related intervals (and recursively, related temporal  objects) as a structured object, as opposed to a relation among such  intervals. This corresponds to the intuition that such structured temporal objects are composite entities, similar for example to physical  objects which are made up of different components. In particular,  calendar time units are composite temporal objects with a particular  structure. Similarly, we view a set of composite and related activities  and events (possibly repetitive), for example medical treatments, as  occurring during temporally structured objects, and thus âinheritingâ  such structure.  We abstract (possibly infinite) lists of temporal terms which follow certain repetitive structure with a new temporal term, a loop. We  assume that (at some level of abstraction) every occurrence of a repetition or repeat in a sequence of events is âthe sameâ; see [15] for a  philosophical analysis. Here we only deal with qualitative information describing a loop repetitive structure. Four parameters provide  the necessary information to define a loop: a single (representative)  cycle, an order relation between consecutive instances of the cycle  or repeats and a repetitions number ; the fourth parameter, an index,    Simon Fraser University,  email:  diana,jim  @cs.sfu.ca  Burnaby,  B.C.,  V5A1S6,  Canada,  distinguishes individual loops which have the same structure parameters. A loop cycle can be an interval, but it can also be recursively  made up of other (related) intervals and/or other loops.  Previous work in the Artificial Intelligence and Temporal  Databases communities have dealt with some sort of structured temporal objects, both interval or point based such as non-convex intervals and linear repeating points; these temporal objects however only  provide a âsingle levelâ structure. Non-convex intervals are sets of  non-intersecting intervals, which âconsist intuitively of some (maximal) convex subintervals with convex gaps in between themâ [11],  page 360. Ligozatâs generalized intervals [13] are ordered sequences  of points which can also denote non-convex intervals. Linear repeating points, (lrps) are defined within generalized databases. They  are mathematical characterization of periodic, and possibly infinite  point sequences, with a finite representation [9]. Nearly periodic  points [18] and linear repeating intervals (lris) [16] extend lrps. Lris  are akin to non-convex intervals where subintervals have the same  duration and are equally distanced. Temporal granularities research  also deals with structure in time, although focused on calendars and  calendar-based time units [4, 6, 12, 16]. In contrast, we propose temporal objects which are not calendar based, although they permit one  to define calendar-based temporal objects. The language presented  here can include any structure with a finite number of nested structured temporal objects, with any qualitative structure; hence a temporal object may include arbitrary gaps. Space limitations preclude  that we include more related literature.  The next section introduces the language and presents the proposed axioms for each temporal object, along with examples and  some results which follow from the axiomatization. The theory is  augmented in Section 3 with the HOLDS predicate and general formulas, with which atemporal assertions are expressed to be true during a certain temporal term. Results are then presented which illustrate the expressive and reasoning power of this theory. Finally, a  comparison of this formalism with other work, and comments on  current and future research, are provided.  2  The terms in the language  The following examples intuitively illustrate the expressive power of  temporal terms.

Other similarity relations could involve alternative qualitative considerations or quantitative information. For example, temporal terms could be required to have the same duration.  The predicate same shape formalizes this concept, and is used in  Axiom l.2. This is where our formalization connects with the intuition of a closed time structure in the sense that repeats are âthe  sameâ. Indeed, we propose that a loop stands for many repeats, all  with the same shape (and therefore representable by) the cycle. Additionally, the cycle itself (as a temporal term) represents a specific  repeat, the first one. This is what Axiom l.3 expresses. Notice that  the index is irrelevant with respect to the loop shape.  Same shape is an equivalence relation; additionally the axioms  sh.1 to sh.4 hold.  )   ;:   "!#    (!#  6         ) 6 .      S         sh.2    6  "   "  6   S                ?)    S      S    6      "?%  6  .      I)   ;    sh.3 Q "6   #     #  "6      ?)      % #  6        /     /      @)   S             6            S             I)     D      sh.4 >  6        6   S      ?)   S      C  #C    C    #C  6    )     "  %N 6       %N     6  sh.1 Q                                      "6  6  @:  6  )  @:    6    :   6      6  .  .

We show how this  relation compares with analogous relations defined in previous related work about ânon-convexâ intervals [11]. Further we present  essentially the same concept but as a composition operation of two  loops. This introduces a different perspective to the concept, leading  to a more succinct way of expressing repetitive temporal patterns.  In previous sections we have dealt with relations between any temporal term when considering their convexification, i.e. considering  terms as a whole. Many other relations exist between temporal terms  when taking into account their subcomponents. Furthermore, it is  possible to define relations between temporal terms which take into  account their defining parameters, their inner structure, and so on.  Here we present one relation between two loops taking into account (all of) the respective repeats, and each repeat considered as a  whole: â 5 â, where 5 is an Allen convex interval relation. The   5 relation is one of the possible extensions of the relation âalways Râ between non-convex intervals as defined in [11], where âRâ  is an Allen relation. In the referred paper binary relations between  non-convex intervals include those that take into account subintervals (such as âalways Râ, âsometimes Râ), and other relations which  take the non-convex interval as a whole (via its convexification).  Briefly, we define the relation  5 to hold between two loops  when the relation 5 holds between their respective convexified repeats. Axioms are omitted for lack of space.  Example 3 Consider the situation âsometimes lunches meet seminars, sometimes lunches are before seminarsâ. This type of example  appears in [14] where a formalism based on Ladkinâs non-convex  intervals is introduced. One way of defining this situation in our language is with two loops, a lunches loop  and 2 a seminars  loop, and  3  4  relating them with the relation   .     This example is revisited below, under a different perspective, by  using one single loop.  Observation 2 If the cycles of two loops have some temporal term  in common then for some Allen relation 5 , the  5 relation may  be inconsistent.  Proof We prove this with an example,  where  the relation     5 cannot  possibly  hold.  Let   % .     and  let  6 %    2        6   .

We define a loop  to be composed by  loops   and  and the Allen relation 5 when its    repeat is a  related pair, where the first component in the pair is the    repeat  of loop   , the second component is the    repeat of loop  and the  relation in the related pair is 5 .

Certain repetitive temporal patterns can be expressed succinctly with a single loop whose cycle is a structured temporal object.  In contrast, if one considers interval cycle loops (analogous to nonconvex intervals), several of such loops are required, together with  the -5 relation. Under this perspective, we review Example 3;  Example 4 âSometimes lunches meet seminars, sometimes  lunches    are  before  seminarsâ  can  be  expressed  with  the  loop    seminar  2  4  3       lunch , ,n).

Other interesting results follow from  considering composed loops and the interconnection between the  loops inter-repeat relation and the composing relation.  3  Formulas: atemporal assertions associated to  temporal terms  We next consider how one can reason with atemporal assertions  that are true during temporal terms. In common with previous work  [2, 17] we introduce HOLDS formulas, where an atomic formula  consists of the HOLDS predicate with two arguments: a temporal  term as defined in98 previous  sections  and a reified proposition. Intu  8  itively HOLDS    , means that is true during  .  We treat atemporal assertions as Allenâs properties in that something is true during an interval if it is true during all the intervals  within. This extends nicely to the behaviour of atemporal assertions  during composite temporal terms, since we require that an assertion  is true during a temporal term if it is true during all its subcomponents. See Axiom H.1 and Theorem 2.  Composed  formulas  are related with the usual logical connec3    )  R4  tives  .

The interpretation we give to negation is that of strong negation, akin8 to the negation for properties  in 8 Allenâs formalization. Hence not( ) holds during a temporal term  if does not hold during any of the temporal term subcomponents.  The âstrong negationâ is not equivalent  but it implies the âweak nega8  )  would  hold during a temporal term  tionâ;  with  weak  negation  not(  8  if does not hold during the temporal term itself. See Axiom H.2  and Theorem 3. We use the predicate subcomponent to shorten the  axioms presentation. Intuitively: intervals which are .in. an interval make up its subcomponents; the two components in a related  pair are subcomponents of the related pair; the first and rest of a ret  are its subcomponents and the repeats associated to a loop are its  subcomponents. Furthermore, subcomponents of subcomponents are  also subcomponents of a temporal term.

Based on convex intervals, we have defined temporal objects which are composed themselves of temporal  terms related in certain ways. This is analogous to how complex objects are composed of different parts and sub-parts. In particular we  deal with temporal repetition, represented with time loops. A time  loop captures in one cycle the core of what is repeated; a loop cycle consists of an interval or a structured object (including other  subloops). The loopâs inter-repeat relation specifies the relation that  holds between each repetition; it can be any interval relation. Hence,  overlapping intervals or sequences of intervals going âbackwardsâ  in time are possible. We have also formalized loops where the repetitions number of the loop is the transfinite number &' . The approach is  formalized in first order logic. The language includes temporal terms  and a HOLDS predicate which has two arguments: a structured temporal term and a (reified) proposition which holds during the temporal term. Several results are presented which intuitively show that the  theory behaves correctly. Our language allows for the compact representation of repeated temporal entities. This would be appropriate for  situations where similarities between repeats are known, which is the  case in many practical applications. Hence we provide an abstraction  mechanism for temporal objects, and so propose (and allow) a further degree of structure in temporal knowledge bases. We are aware  of one medical system [5] that has recently incorporated these ideas  based on our previous version of the language [7]. Examples such as  lunches meet seminars or  lunches3 are before  seminars are  covered  2  04      within one loop:  seminar    lunch , ,n). This  type of example appears in [14]. o express the above example with  non-convex intervals instead of loops, there would exist two different  non-convex intervals, âseminarsâ and âlunchesâ, one corresponding  to the set of seminars and the other to the lunches. This example  would then be expressed as a relation between correlated pairs using  non-convex intervals: each single seminar meets or is after each single âclosestâ lunch. In the presented formalism the linking relation  between âclosestâ seminars and lunches is made explicit, as being  part of a cycle given in the loop construct.  As mentioned above, work in formalizing calendars and time units  also deals with structured time. However, such work is focused on  calendar-based notions, and does not attempt to present a formalization of what (structured) temporal repetition essentially is. We here  propose a generic paradigm to treat time; we formalize it with temporal objects which include structure (via qualitative relations in this  document). Furthermore we propose a succinct way of representing  repetitive temporal patterns.  Current and future research includes exploring results that follow  from the axiomatization, formally proving the consistency of the theory and a study of the suitability of this formalism to reason within  practical applications. Constraint propagation algorithms which apply to the defined temporal objects and profit from the specific (one  cycle based) structure that we propose are also part of future research.  An extension is to incorporate quantitative information into the formalism. This would allow one for example to quantitatively specify  calendars and granularity systems in general.
