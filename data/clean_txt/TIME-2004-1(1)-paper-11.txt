Shilov  Institute of  Informatics Systems  Lavrentev av. 6,  Novosibirsk 630090, Russia  shilov@iis.nsk.su  Abstract  We study the model checking problem for fixpoint logics  in well-structured multiaction transition systems. P.A. Abdulla et al (1996) and Finkel & Schnoebelen (2001) examined the decidability problem for liveness (reachability)  and progress (eventuality) properties in well-structured single action transition systems. Our main result is as follows:  the model checking problem is decidable for disjunctive formulae of the propositional µ-Calculus of D. Kozen (1983) in  well-structured transition systems where propositional variables are interpreted by upward cones. We also discuss the  model checking problem for the intuitionistic modal logic of  Fisher Servi (1984) extended by least fixpoint.  1. Well-Preordered Transition Systems  Let D be a set. An equivalence is a reflexive, transitive  and symmetric binary relation on D. A partial order is a reflexive, transitive, and antisymmetric binary relation on D.  A preorder (synonym: quasi-order) is a reflexive and transitive binary relation on D. A well-preorder (synonym: wellquasi-order) is a preorder  where every infinite sequence  d0 , ... di , ... of elements of D contains a pair of elements dm  and dn so that m < n and dm  dn .  Let (D, ) be a well-preordered set (i.e. a set D provided  with a well-preorder ). An ideal (synonym: cone) is an upward closed subset of D, i.e. a set I ⊆ D such that for all  d0 , d00 ∈ D, if d0  d00 and d0 ∈ I then d00 ∈ I. Every d ∈ D  generates the upward cone (↑ d) ≡ {e ∈ D : d  e}. For  every set S ⊆ D and every element d ∈ S, d is a minimal element of S iff for every element s ∈ S either d  s  or d and s are non-comparable. For every subset S ⊆ D,  the set of its minimal elements is min(S). For every subset S ⊆ D, a basis of S is a subset B ⊆ S such that for  every s ∈ S there exists an element b ∈ B such that b  s.  V. A. Sokolov  Yaroslavl State University  Sovetskay st. 14,  Yaroslavl 150000, Russia  sokolov@uniyar.ac.ru  Let us present some algebraic properties of well-preorders that are easy to prove [1, 4]. Let us fix for simplicity  a well-preordered set (D, ). First, (D, ) is well-founded,  i.e. infinite strictly decreasing sequences of elements of D  are impossible; moreover, every infinite sequence in (D, )  contains an infinite non-decreasing subsequence. Next, every subset S ⊆ D provided with the preorder  also forms  another well-preordered set (S, ). Third, every S ⊆ D  has a finite basis that consist of the set of the minimal elements min(S); in particular, every ideal I has a finite basis min(I), and I = ∪d∈min(I) (↑ d). Finally, every nondecreasing sequence of ideals I0 ⊆ ... ⊆ Ii ⊆ ... eventually stabilizes, i.e. there is some k ≥ 0 such that Im = In  for all m, n ≥ k.  Let Act be a fixed finite alphabet of action symbols.  A transition system (synonym: Kripke frame) is a tuple  (D, R), where the domain D is a non-empty set of elements  that are called states, and the interpretation R is a total mapping R : Act → 2D×D . A run (in the frame) is a maximal sequence of states s1 ...si si+1 ... such that for all adjacent states within the sequence (si , si+1 ) ∈ R(a) for some  a ∈ Act.  A well-preordered transition system (WPTS) is a triple  (D, , R) such that (D, ) is a well-preordered set and  (D, R) is a Kripke frame. We are most interested in wellpreordered transition systems with decidable and compatible well-preorders and interpretations. The decidability  condition for the well-preorder is straightforward:  ⊆  D × D is decidable. The decidability condition for interpretations of action symbols and compatibility conditions  for well-preorders and interpretations of action symbols are  discussed below.  Let (D, , R) be a WPTS and a ∈ Act be an action symbol. We consider the following decidable condition for the  interpretation R(a) of the action symbol a ∈ Act: the funcR(a)  tion λ s ∈ D . min{t : t −→ s} is computable. We refer to  this condition as tractable past.  Again, let (D, , R) be a WPTS and a ∈ Act be an ac-  (future) upward  ∀s01 , s001 , s02 ∃s002 :  R(a)  s01 −→ s001 & s01  s02 ⇒  R(a)  ⇒ s02 −→ s002 & s001  s002  00  s1 . . . s002  ↑  ↑  |  |  s01  s02  −   ◦R(a) ⊆ R(a)◦ −  (future) downward  ∀s01 , s02 , s002 ∃s001 :  R(a)  s02 −→ s002 & s01  s02 ⇒  R(a)  ⇒ s01 −→ s001 & s001  s002  s001 . . . s002  ↑  |  |  ↑  s01  s02   ◦R(a) ⊆ R(a) ◦   Table 1. (Future) Fisher Servi conditions  tion symbol. There are 2 options for strong future compatibility of the well-preorder  and the interpretation R(a) of  the action symbol a ∈ Act. They are represented in the table 1 in logic, diagram, and algebraic notation (rows 1, 2,  and 3 respectively). The terminology used in these tables is  explained in the following three paragraphs.  The adjectives ”upward” and ”downward” have been introduced by [4]; they have explicit mnemonics. The adjective ”strong” has also been introduced by [4]; it refers to  a single step of action R(a) that interprets the corresponding action symbol a. In accordance with [4], one can define the transitive, the reflexive and ”plain” compatibility by  +  using the transitive closure R(a) , the reflexive closure    ∗  = ∪ R(a) and the reflexive-transitive closure R(a)  instead of the single step R(a). The adjective ”future” is  about states after an action, i.e. future states, while states  before an action are past states.  The Fisher Servi conditions are due to intuitionistic  modal logic FS suggested by G. Fisher Servi [5] (see also  [8] and [3]). Semantics of FS is defined in partially ordered transition systems (D, , R), where  is a partial order which is upward and downward compatible with R.  Let M be a WPTS. We say that M has tractable past, iff  it enjoys this property for every action symbol a ∈ Act. Let  us fix a particular compatibility property from the table 1;  we say that M has this property, iff it enjoys it for every action symbol a ∈ Act.  An upward compatible well-preordered transition system with tractable past and decidable preorder is said to be  a well-structured transition system (WSTS). Extensive case  study and some generic examples of single action1 WSTS  can be found in the foundational papers [1, 4].  We would like to point out that there are close relations  between compatibility and (bi)simulation [7, 10]. Let (D,   , R) be a WPTS. One can see that  • future upward compatibility states that the well-pre1  i.e. when |Act| = 1  order  is a simulation relation on the states of the  transition system (D, R);  • future downward compatibility states that the inverse  − of the well-preorder  is a simulation relation on  the states of the transition system (D, R).  These observations lead to the following proposition.  Proposition 1  Every transition system (D, R) provided with any bisimulation ' on the states in D forms a Fisher Servi compatible WPTS (D, ', R). In particular, (D, R) provided with  equality forms a Fisher Servi compatible WPTS (D, =, R).  2. Propositional µ-Calculus  The µ-Calculus of D.Kozen (µC) [6] is a very powerful propositional program logic with fixpoints. It is widely  used for specification and verification of properties of finite state systems. (Please refer to [9] for the elementary introduction to µC. The comprehensive definition of µC can  be found, for example, in a recent textbook [2].) Some authors denote the µ-Calculus with the single action symbol  by L♦µν since in the single action settings it becomes a  propositional modal logic with two modalities ( and ♦)  extended by fixpoints (µ and ν). If to assume standard duality between modalities  and ♦ and between fixpoints µ  and ν then L♦µν becomes µK – the basic propositional  modal logic K extended by fixpoints.  The syntax of µC consists of formulae. Let P rp be an alphabet of propositional variables which is disjoint with the  alphabet of action symbols Act fixed above. A context-free  definition of µC formulae is as follows:  φ ::= p | (¬φ) | (φ ∧ φ) | (φ ∨ φ) |  ([a]φ) | (haiφ) | (ν p. φ) | (µ p. φ)  where metavariables φ, p, and a range over formulae,  propositional variables and action symbols. The only context constraint is the following: no instances of bound (by  µ or ν) propositional variables are in the range of odd number of negations.  The semantics of µC is defined in labeled transition  systems (synonym: Kripke models). A model is a triple  (D, R, V ), where (D, R) is a Kripke frame, and the valuation V is another total mapping V : P rp → 2D . In every  model M = (D, R, V ), for every formula φ, the semantics M (φ) is a subset of the domain D that is defined by induction on the formula structure:  • M (p) = V (p), M (¬ψ) = D \ M (ψ),  M (ψ 0 ∧ ψ 00 ) = M (ψ 0 ) ∩ M (ψ 00 ),  M (ψ 0 ∨ ψ 00 ) = M (ψ 0 ) ∪ M (ψ 00 ),  • M ([a]ψ) = { s : t ∈ M (ψ)  for every t such that (s, t) ∈ R(a) },  M (haiψ) = { s : t ∈ M (ψ)  for some t such that (s, t) ∈ R(a) },  • M (νp.ψ) = the greatest fixpoint of the mapping      M (µp.ψ) = the least fixpoint of the mapping      λS ⊆ D . MS/p (ψ) ,  λS ⊆ D . MS/p (ψ) ,  where metavariables ψ, ψ 0 , ψ 00 , p, and a range over formulae, propositional variables and action symbols, and MS/p  denotes the model that agrees with M everywhere but p:  VS/p (p) = S.  A propositional variable is said to be a propositional constant in a formula iff it is free in the formula. A formula  is said to be in the normal form iff negation is applied to  propositional constants in the formula only. A formula is  said to be positive iff it is negation-free. Due to the standard De Morgan laws and the following equivalences  (¬(haiφ)) ↔ ([a](¬φ))  (¬([a]φ)) ↔ (hai(¬φ))  (¬p)  (¬(µp.φ)) ↔ (νp. (¬(φp ))  (¬p)  (¬(νp.φ)) ↔ (µp. (¬(φp ))  every formula of µC is equivalent to some formula in the  normal form that can be constructed in polynomial time.  (Here and throughout the paper XZY stays for substitution  of Y instead of all instances of Z into X.)  We are especially interested in the fragment of the µCalculus that comprises the disjunctive formulae, i.e. formulae without negations ¬, conjunctions ∧, and ”infinite  conjunctions” [ ] and ν. A context-free definition of these  formulae is the following:  φ ::= p | (φ ∨ φ) | (haiφ) | (µ p. φ),  where metavariables φ, p, and a range over formulae,  propositional variables and action symbols. We can remark that liveness and progress properties are easy to  present in this fragment: EFp ↔ µq. (p ∨ hnextiq) and  AFp ↔ µq. (p ∨ [next]q), where next is the single implicit action symbol of CTL.  Another logic that we use in our studies is the Fisher  Servi intuitionistic modal logic FS [5, 8, 3]. The syntax of  FS consists of formulae that are constructed from propositional variables P rp in accordance with the following  context-free definition:  states,  is a partial order on D, the interpretation R interprets the single implicit action symbol (say next) by a binary relation R(next) ⊆ D × D in an upward and downward compatible manner with , and the valuation V is a  total mapping V : P rp → {I ⊆ D : I is a cone in (D,   )}.  In every model M = (D, , R, V ), for every formula φ,  the semantics M (φ) is a subset of the domain D that is defined by induction on the formula structure:  • M (p) = V (p), M (¬ψ) = {s : (↑ s) ∩ M (ψ) = ∅},  M (ψ 0 → ψ 00 ) = {s : (↑ s) ∩ M (ψ 0 ) ⊆ M (ψ 00 )},  M (ψ 0 ∧ ψ 00 ) = M (ψ 0 ) ∩ M (ψ 00 ),  M (ψ 0 ∨ ψ 00 ) = M (ψ 0 ) ∪ M (ψ 00 ),  • M (ψ) = { s : (↑ t) ⊆ M (ψ)  for every t such that (s, t) ∈ R(next) },  M (♦ψ) = { s : t ∈ M (ψ)  for some t such that (s, t) ∈ R(next) }.  where metavariables ψ, ψ 0 , ψ 00 , and p range over formulae and propositional variables, respectively. (Sic! In contrast to classical modal logics, there is no standard duality  between  and ♦ in intuitionistic modal logic.)  Please refer to papers [5, 8, 3]. for finite model property,  axiomatization, and decidability issues of FS, but let us define a variant µFS of FS with multiactions and fixpoints  as follows. The syntax of µFS coincides with the syntax  of µC. The semantics of µFS is defined in models that are  partially ordered Fisher Servi compatible labeled transition  systems. A model of this kind is a quadruple (D, , R, V ),  where the domain D is a nonempty set of states,  is a partial order on D, the interpretation R is a total mapping R :  Act → 2D×D that interprets every action symbol a ∈ Act  by a binary relation R(a) ⊆ D ×D in an upward and downward compatible manner with , and the valuation V is a  total mapping V : P rp → {I ⊆ D : I is a cone in (D, )}  (i.e., it interprets every propositional variable p ∈ P rp by  some ideal in (D, )).  In every model M = (D, , R, V ), for every formula φ,  the semantics M Int (φ) is a subset of the domain D that is  defined by induction on the formula structure:  φ ::= p | (¬φ) | (φ → φ) | (φ ∧ φ) | (φ ∨ φ)  | (φ) | (♦φ)  • M Int (p) = V (p),  M Int (¬ψ) = {s : (↑ s) ∩ M Int (ψ) = ∅},  M Int (ψ 0 → ψ 00 ) =  = {s : (↑ s) ∩ M Int (ψ 0 ) ⊆ M Int (ψ 00 )},  Int  0  M (ψ ∧ ψ 00 ) = M Int (ψ 0 ) ∩ M Int (ψ 00 ),  M Int (ψ 0 ∨ ψ 00 ) = M Int (ψ 0 ) ∪ M Int (ψ 00 ),  where metavariables φ and p range over formulae and  propositional variables. FS semantics is defined in intuitionistic Kripke models. A model of this kind is a quadruple  (D, , R, V ), where the domain D is a nonempty set of  • M Int ([a]ψ) = { s : (↑ t) ⊆ M Int (ψ)  for every t such that (s, t) ∈ R(a) },  M Int (haiψ) = { s : t ∈ M Int (ψ)  for some t such that (s, t) ∈ R(a) },  • M Int (νp.ψ) = the greatest fixpoint of the   mapping  Int  λS ⊆ D . MS/p  (ψ) ,  M Int (µp.ψ) = the least fixpoint of the mapping      Int  λS ⊆ D . MS/p  (ψ) ,  where metavariables ψ, ψ 0 , ψ 00 , p, and a range over formuInt  lae, propositional variables and action symbols, and MS/p  Int  denotes the model that agrees with M  everywhere but p:  VS/p (p) = S.  The following proposition is standard for intuitionistic  logic.  Proposition 2 For every µFS model M , for every formula  φ of µFS, the intuitionistic semantics M Int (φ) is an upward cone.  We are especially interested in the fragment of µFS that  comprises the disjunctive formulae, i.e. formulae without  negations ¬, implications →, conjunctions ∧, and ”infinite  conjunctions” [ ] and ν, i.e. they coincide with the disjunctive formulae of µC. It is easy to observe that clauses  responsible for semantics of the disjunctive formulae in  µC and in µFS also coincide. It leads to the following  proposition.  Proposition 3  For every µFS model M , for every disjunctive µFS formula φ, the intuitionistic semantics M Int (φ) coincides with  the classical semantics M (φ).  3. The Main Result and Conclusion  A well-structured labeled transition system is a quadruple (D, , R, V ), where (D, R, V ) is a labeled transition  system, and (D, , R) is a well-structured transition system. An ideal-based model is a well-structured labeled transition system (D, , R, V ), where V : P rp → {I ⊆ D :  I is a cone in (D, )}, i.e. it interprets every propositional  variable p ∈ P rp by some ideal in (D, ). In particular, every µFS model is an ideal-based model that is also downward compatible.  Proposition 4 For every positive formula φ of the µC without conjunctions ∧, boxes [ ], and greatest fixpoints ν, for  every ideal-based model M , the semantics M (φ) is an  ideal. Moreover, if valuations of all propositional constants  in φ are defined by their finite bases, then some finite basis for M (φ) is computable.  Let M be a class of models, Φ be a class of formulae.  The model checking problem for M and Φ is to decide the  following set    (φ, M, s) : φ ∈ Φ, M ∈ M and s ∈ M (φ) .  The following theorem is a corollary from propositions 3  and 4.  Theorem 1 The model checking problem is decidable for  the ideal-based models and the disjunctive formulae of the  propositional µ-Calculus. It is also decidable for the disjunctive formulae of the intuitionistic modal logic with least  fixpoints µFS in the models with tractable past.  Acknowledgment. Authors would like to thanks S.P.
