      "2 / 2707 Time, as a phenomenon, has been in the focus of scientific thought from ancient times.\n",
      "3 / 2707 It continues to be an important subject of research in many disciplines due to its importance as a basic aspect for understanding and formally representing change.\n",
      "4 / 2707 The goal of this analytical review is to find out if the formal representations of time developed to date suffice to the needs of the basic and applied research in Computer Science, and in particular within the Artificial Intelligence and Semantic Web communities.\n",
      "5 / 2707 To analyze if the existing basic theories, models, and implemented ontologies of time cower these needs well, the set of the features of time has been extracted and appropriately structured using the paper collection of the TIME Symposia series as the document corpus.\n",
      "6 / 2707 This feature set further helped to structure the comparative review and analysis of the most prominent temporal theories.\n",
      "7 / 2707 As a result, the selection of the subset of the features of time (the requirements for a Synthetic Theory) has been made reflecting the TIME community sentiment.\n",
      "8 / 2707 Further, the temporal logics, representation languages, and ontologies available to date, have been reviewed regarding their usability aspects and the coverage of the selected temporal features.\n",
      "9 / 2707 The results reveal that the reviewed ontologies of time taken together do not satisfactorily cover some important features: (i) density; (ii) relaxed linearity; (iii) scale factors; (iv) proper and periodic subintervals; (v) temporal measures and clocks.\n",
      "10 / 2707 It has been concluded that a cross-disciplinary effort is required to address the features not covered by the existing ontologies of time, and also harmonize the representations addressed differently.\n",
      "11 / 2707 Keywords: Time; sentiment; temporal feature; coverage; ontology; representation; reasoning.\n",
      "12 / 2707 1.\n",
      "13 / 2707 Introduction\n",
      "14 / 2707 It is acknowledged that when God made time, he made plenty of it.\n",
      "15 / 2707 Remarkably, when it goes about the formal treatment of time, the status is very much following this Irish saying.\n",
      "16 / 2707 Time, as a phenomenon, has been in the focus of scientific thought from ancient times.\n",
      "17 / 2707 Today it continues to be an important subject of research for philosophers, physicists, mathematicians, logicians, computer scientists, and even biologists.\n",
      "18 / 2707 One reason, perhaps, is that time is a fundamental aspect to understand and react to change in the World, including the broadest diversity of applications that impact the evolution of the Humankind.\n",
      "19 / 2707 So, the progress in understanding the World in its dynamics: (a) is based on having an adequately rich and deep model of time; and (b) pushes forward the further refinement of our time models.\n",
      "20 / 2707 For example, in Computer Science the developments in Artificial Intelligence, Databases, Distributed Systems, etc.\n",
      "21 / 2707 in the last two decades have brought to life several prominent theoretical frameworks dealing with temporal aspects.\n",
      "22 / 2707 Some parts of these theories gave boost to the research in logics  yielding a family of temporal logics, comprising temporal description logics.\n",
      "23 / 2707 Based on this logical foundation, knowledge representation languages have received their capability to represent time, and several ontologies of time have been implemented by the Semantic Web community.\n",
      "24 / 2707 It is however important to find out if this plenty is enough to meet the requirement in Computer Science research and development.\n",
      "25 / 2707 The objective of this analytic review paper is to answer this question  i.e.\n",
      "26 / 2707 to find out if the formal representations of time developed to date suffice to the needs of coping with different aspects of change.\n",
      "27 / 2707 The remainder of the paper is structured as follows.\n",
      "28 / 2707 To assess the sufficiency of this coverage, the consensual set of the features of time has to be extracted and appropriately structured.\n",
      "29 / 2707 This is done by analyzing the document corpus produced by the chosen professional community.\n",
      "30 / 2707 As the focus of our interest lies in the formal representations of time, the TIME community* has been chosen.\n",
      "31 / 2707 The document corpus for temporal feature extraction has been formed of the proceedings papers of the TIME Symposia series from 1994 to date.\n",
      "32 / 2707 As presented in Section 2, the OntoElect methodology has been used for the extraction of the set of Temporal Features.\n",
      "33 / 2707 Using OntoElect also allowed us to receive the evidence that the extracted set of features represents a consensual sentiment of the TIME community about the requirements to the formalizations of time.\n",

      "379 / 2707 A philosophical doctrine about the bounded*** and cyclic nature of time has perhaps been inspired by one of the archaic thoughts describing the evolution of the world  the Heraclituses theory of transmutation.\n",
      "380 / 2707 Heraclitus considered that the world was involved in an infinite cycle of birth and death.\n",

      "382 / 2707 Another argument in favor of the cyclic character of time for the antique philosophers was found in their observations of the celestial phenomena.\n",
      "383 / 2707 For example, Plato believed that time was being caused by the revolution of the celestial sphere(s) and emerged with it.\n",
      "384 / 2707 The representatives of the Atomistic school were the first to drop the circular view on the nature of time in favor of considering it as not a derivative of celestial sphere motion, but a separate aspect of nature.\n",
      "385 / 2707 They stated, stressing the infinity and unboundedness of time, that time was not created  hence, there is no the beginning of time.\n",
      "386 / 2707 However, they did not consider time as unbounded (open) in the future.\n",
      "387 / 2707 Aristotle**** considered that time could be measured by a uniform circular motion.\n",

      "396 / 2707 The theory by Prior (1967) also allows both for unbounded and bounded domains of time, depending on the alternatives in logical postulates.\n",

      "463 / 2707 The reason for their choice is that the applications / phenomena, from which the inspiration is taken, hint that things do not happen discontinuously.\n",
      "464 / 2707 McDermott (1982) models the continuity of time by having a continuum of instances between any two instants, using reals as the domain for these instances.\n",

      "2109 / 2707 To figure out what is the representative set of the Features of Time, a concise representation of the opinion of these communities was extracted and represented in a structured form.\n",
      "2110 / 2707 For the reconstruction of the community sentiment, the materialized product (the collection of scientific papers) of the community members was processed.\n",
      "2111 / 2707 TIME community has been selected as the most fitting provider of the document collection for our analysis.\n",
      "2112 / 2707 This TIME document collection has been assessed for its representativeness, and further used to extract the characteristic set of time features which constitute the opinion of TIME authors developed in the last two decades.\n",
      "2113 / 2707 The flat list of terms has been extracted from the document collection as described in Section 2.\n",
      "2114 / 2707 This term list has been further manually cleaned with 686 terms retained.\n",
      "2115 / 2707 The terms were also classified as indicated in Table 2.\n",
      "2116 / 2707 One of the classification groups was the Features of time containing 175 members.\n",
      "2117 / 2707 The terms belonging to this group were further analyzed and the taxonomy of the Temporal Features suggested by the TIME community sentiment has been built as pictured in Fig.\n",
      "2118 / 2707 3.\n",
      "2119 / 2707 This taxonomy has been further used to structure the discussion as well as to assess the reviewed temporal theories, models, and ontologies in the subsequent sections of the paper.\n",
      "2120 / 2707 Further, the most prominent theories of time have been reviewed regarding the set of extracted temporal features in Section 3.\n",
      "2121 / 2707 The theories have been chosen based on the number of their citations and also by the potential coverage of the extracted features.\n",
      "2122 / 2707 It has been noted that all the reviewed theories were in fact the theories of temporal incidence.\n",
      "2123 / 2707 So, attention has been paid only to their parts representing the basic models of time.\n",
      "2124 / 2707 The analysis revealed that there was no one single basic theory of time, among the reviewed, which covers all the temporal features advised by the TIME community sentiment.\n",
      "2125 / 2707 However, in their combination the coverage was extensive, though not complete.\n",
      "2126 / 2707 The major gaps revealed by the comparative analysis were:\n",
      "2127 / 2707 * In the High-Level Features: periodicity in time structures; uncertainty or fuzziness in time instants and intervals\n",
      "2128 / 2707 * In Temporal Elements: convexity and non-convexity of time intervals; fuzziness in time points and intervals\n",
      "2129 / 2707 * In Temporal Structures: account for temporal periods, and calendar structures\n",
      "2130 / 2707 * In Temporal Properties: account for date/time formats\n",
      "2131 / 2707 * In Temporal Relations: periodic sub-intervals; fuzzy relations between points, intervals, points and intervals\n",
      "2132 / 2707 One possible reason for the lack of the account for the temporal features is that a theory, per se, has to be deliberately minimalistic.\n",
      "2133 / 2707 Another outlined reason was that the theories under review were the theories of temporal incidence inspired by particular applications.\n",
      "2134 / 2707 So they covered the features required in the domains they address.\n",
      "2135 / 2707 It should however be noted that the application coverage by the reviewed theories, as pictured in Table 7, was sufficiently complete with respect to the focus of this review in Semantic Technologies and Artificial Intelligence.\n",
      "2136 / 2707 As a result of the analysis of the temporal theories, a set of requirements for a Synthetic Theory of time has been outlined.\n",
      "2137 / 2707 This combination of feature choices was further used to check the expressive power, in the terms of coverage, of the existing logical frameworks, implemented declarative languages, and ontologies in Section 4.\n",
      "2138 / 2707 The languages and ontologies were also analyzed regarding their usability in the terms of compliance to existing standards or recommendations.\n",
      "2139 / 2707 In addition, reasoning and querying support were also the factors taken into account in the analysis.\n",
      "2140 / 2707 Since OWL offers its direct support only to binary relations, all W3C compliant solutions, such as reification and 4D fluents, suffer from the proliferation of objects, which is not the case for approaches such as quintuples and annotated RDF.\n",
      "2141 / 2707 On the other hand, the W3C compliant approaches offer reasoning and querying support and they can be combined with the existing tools (e.g., triple stores, editors, SPARQL query engines and reasoners) thus being more useful in practice than the solutions that are not W3C compliant.\n",
      "2142 / 2707 Finally, the ontologies covering temporal aspects, implemented in an ontology specification language, have been selected for the analysis based on their current availability for re-use.\n",
      "2143 / 2707 These ontologies, listed in Table 9, were grouped as Foundational or Upper-Level and Ontologies of Time.\n"

Sattar  School of Information Technology,  Griffith University Gold Coast,  Southport, Qld, Australia 4215  {j.thornton, m.beaumont, a.sattar}@mailbox.gu.edu.au  Abstract  Local search techniques have attracted considerable interest in the Artificial Intelligence (AI) community since the  development of GSAT [9] and the min-conflicts heuristic  [5] for solving large propositional satisfiability (SAT) problems and binary Constraint Satisfaction Problems (CSPs)  respectively.\n",

      "154 / 225 4.3.\n",
      "155 / 225 Results  The TSAT algorithm is specifically intended to solve  problems which are too large or difficult for a standard  backtracking and path-consistency approach.\n",
      "156 / 225 To address  this we set out to create a problem set on which backtracking has difficulty.\n",
      "157 / 225 Using Nebel’s generator [6], we firstly  created two large sets of random, consistent problems.\n",
      "158 / 225 The  first set was made up of 40 node problems with degree =  75% and label size = 9.5.\n",
      "159 / 225 In the second set the number of nodes was increased to 80.\n",
      "160 / 225 We then ran both test  sets on Nebel’s backtracking-based problem solver [6] until  100 problems were found in each set that backtracking had  failed to solve (the 40 node problems were timed out after 5  minutes and the 80 node after 10 minutes).\n",
      "161 / 225 We then solved  each of these problems 10 times using the TSAT algorithm  (all experiments were conducted on a Intel Pentium Celeron  450MHz machine with 160Mb of RAM running FreeBSD  4.2).\n",
      "162 / 225 The graphs in Figures 4 and 5 show the proportion of problems solved against the average run-times for TSAT.\n",
      "163 / 225 Each  problem is considered solved if an answer is found in at  least one of the 10 runs of TSAT.\n",
      "164 / 225 The graph run-times  are then calculated by dividing the total time taken for all  10 runs by the number of successful runs (in parallel with  Nebel’s algorithm, TSAT was timed out at 5 minutes for  the 40 node problems and 10 minutes for 80 nodes).\n",
      "165 / 225 As  TSAT solved all problems in less than 10 runs, both graphs  show 100% success, whereas the % solved value in Table  2 reports the overall success rate for the 1000 runs on each  problem set.\n",
      "166 / 225 The 40 node problem results indicate that TSAT finds these  instances relatively easy, with 100% of problems solved  within 20 seconds and a median run-time of 4.11 seconds.\n",
      "167 / 225 This is in contrast to Nebel’s algorithm which failed to solve  any of these problems after 300 seconds.\n",
      "168 / 225 As would be expected, the 80 node problems proved harder for TSAT, with  18% failure at 600 seconds and a median run-time of 215  seconds.\n",
      "169 / 225 However, on average, TSAT is still able to solve  any of the randomly generated 80-node instances in less  than the 600 second time-out at which Nebel’s algorithm  was terminated.\n",
      "170 / 225 While it can be argued that we have chosen just those problems on which Nebel’s algorithm has difficulty, and hence  that our comparison is biased, our intention is not to show  that TSAT is superior to backtracking in all situations, just  in those cases where backtracking has difficulty.\n",
      "171 / 225 If the  lessons from SAT are carried across to the temporal reasoning domain, we would expect backtracking to be better on smaller/easier problems and always to be used when  the objective is to prove inconsistency.\n",
      "172 / 225 The current TSAT  algorithm represents a first pass at using local search for  temporal reasoning and so has not been optimised for the  temporal reasoning domain.\n",
      "173 / 225 For instance, the TSAT parameter settings were taken directly from the SAT algorithm  from which it was developed.\n",
      "174 / 225 Also, given the relatively  small number of average moves taken during the search  (224 for 40 nodes and 1235 for 80 nodes), it is unlikely  the TSAT weight reduction heuristic is having a significant  effect.\n",
